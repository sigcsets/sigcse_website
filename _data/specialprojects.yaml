Guests include university CS educators in various positions, Computer Scientists in industry positions with particular insight on CS education, CS education researchers, and non-traditional CS educators. The show's goals include spreading best CS education practices, inspiring educators to try innovative practices, sharing viewpoints with educators that they would rarely receive, and exposing the often private practice of teaching. The project will yield an improved, sustainable web and social media presence; sixteen polished episodes that are easy to view, search, and share; and an ongoing positive impact on dissemination of ideas in CS education."

  award: $3,500
  date: November 2019
  description: "A number of ambitious projects such as ASLCORE 6 and ASLClear 7 are working on creating American Sign Language (ASL) signs for STEM disciplines. For example, in the computer science domain, ASLCORE has produced signs for concepts such as “Recursion”, “Debugger”, “Linked List” and “Variable”. In this way, computer science jargon is being made accessible to students who are hearing impaired. Drag and Drop coding applications such as MIT’s Scratch 8 are popularly used to teach K-12 students to code. Our project aims to make computer science concepts, using Block-based coding, a more inclusive experience for hearing impaired students."
