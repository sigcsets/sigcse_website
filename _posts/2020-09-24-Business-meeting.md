SIGCSE is required to have a business meeting per its bylaws on a yearly basis. Normally, this meeting occurs at the Technical Symposium. As you are aware, the Technical Symposium in March 2020 did not occur as expected. As such, we are holding an online business meeting this year. There will actually be two meetings to better enable global participation. The content presented at the two meetings will be the same. The meetings will be recorded. The business meeting for 2021 will take place during the 2021 Technical Symposium.
