Due to the financial commitments of hosting the 2021 Technical Symposium online, the SIGCSE Board regretfully announces the suspension of the SIGCSE Travel Grant awards for 2020 (for use at the 2021 Technical Symposium).

It is our intention to reinstate the [Travel Grants]({{"programs/travel-grants/index.html"|absolute_url}}) for our next in-person Technical Symposium, which is scheduled for 2022.
