The SIGCSE Board is pleased to announce the opening of applications for the 2022 Travel Grant Program. The Travel Grant Program was established through a generous, multi-year  donation by Henry Walker to support faculty and teachers who have not yet had an opportunity to attend the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We anticipate funding twenty new awards for the 2022 Symposium.

Faculty and teachers who have never attended the Symposium in person and do not have institutional support to attend are encouraged to apply for the program using an online form: <https://forms.gle/VvdutSfHqgtjSNXz5> Completion of the form requires some basic demographic information, a SIGCSE member number, and a two-part essay that includes a brief description of how attendance will benefit the applicant and how the applicant plans to share what they have learned with their community. Applicants are provided with $500 for travel costs and registration for the Symposium.

Applications for the 2022 Symposium must be received by November 1, 2021 AOE to be considered. Due to reviewing constraints, no late applications will be accepted. Please encourage faculty and teachers at your institution who could benefit from Symposium attendance to apply. Priority for awards are given to applicants from groups that historically have been underrepresented among attendees at the conference. More information about the program and the application process can be found on the Travel Grant Program page: <https://sigcse.org/programs/travel-grants/index.html>

If you have questions about the Travel Grant Program that are not answered by the page listed above, please contact the Travel Grant Program committee at <apply@sigcse.org>.
