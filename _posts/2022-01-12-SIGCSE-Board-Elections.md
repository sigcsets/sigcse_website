Anyone interested in petitioning must inform ACM Headquarters, Pat Ryan (ryanp@hq.acm.org), and Leo Porter (leporter@eng.ucsd.edu), who is the current secretary of SIGCSE, of their intent to petition by 15 March 2022. Petitions must be submitted to ACM Headquarters for verification by 1 April 2022.
