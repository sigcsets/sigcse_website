ACM has just released the information about the newly named ACM Fellows. **Judith Gal-Ezer** from the Open University of Israel, current SIGCSE member, and 2007 winner of the SIGCSE Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education award is included on this list “For contributions to research and implementation in computer science education.”

Please join me and the SIGCSE Board in congratulating Judith on this well-deserved honor.
