The SIGCSE Board invites applications for the next round of SIGCSE Special Project Grants.  The deadline for this round is **November 15, 2022**.

Special Project Grants of up to US $5000 are awarded each year to support projects that will bring some clear benefit to the computing education community in the form of new knowledge, developing or sharing of a resource, or good practice in learning, teaching, or assessment.  An indication of the range of possibilities for projects may be gained from the descriptions of projects that have been funded in previous rounds (see [{{"/programs/special/"|absolute_url}}]({{"/programs/special/"|absolute_url}})). The Special Project Grants are competitive and only available to SIGCSE members.

For details of the Special Project Grants program and the application process see [{{"/programs/special/"|absolute_url}}]({{"/programs/special/"|absolute_url}}). The review process aims for a fast turnaround and applicants will be notified around four to six weeks after applications close. Limited feedback may be given to unsuccessful applicants.  Applicants have the option of re-submitting in a future round.

Questions about the grant or application process are welcome and may be directed to the Special Projects review panel at <apply@sigcse.org>.
