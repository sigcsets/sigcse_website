On behalf of ACM SIGCSE and the highly regarded RESPECT (Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology) Conference, we are happy to announce that the RESPECT conference will now be integrated as one of the flagship conferences under the ACM SIGCSE umbrella. The RESPECT Conference, recognized for its dedication to explore and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the fields of engineering, computing, and technology, aligns seamlessly with ACM SIGCSE's mission to foster innovation and excellence in computer science education worldwide.

This integration underscores the commitment of both organizations to drive positive change and create an inclusive environment within the realm of computing education. By combining resources, expertise, and networks, ACM SIGCSE and the RESPECT Conference aim to elevate their collective impact on shaping the future of computer science education.

The RESPECT Conference, now an integral part of ACM SIGCSE's conference series, will continue to provide a platform for researchers, educators, and practitioners to engage in meaningful discussions, present cutting-edge research, and share best practices that contribute to creating a more equitable and inclusive computing education landscape.

The next RESPECT conference will be held on [May 16th & 17th at the Georgia Tech Conference Centre & Hotel in Atlanta, GA, USA](https://www.respect2024.starscomputingcorps.org).

We are delighted to welcome the RESPECT conference into the SIGCSE family.  This integration represents a significant step forward in our shared commitment to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in computing education. By joining forces, we can amplify our efforts, share valuable insights, and collaborate more effectively to address critical challenges facing our community.

Alison Clear, Chair ACM SIGCSE and Jamie Payton, Chair, RESPECT
