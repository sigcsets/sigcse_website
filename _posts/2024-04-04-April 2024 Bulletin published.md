The April 2024 (Volume 56, Issue 2) of SIGCSE _Bulletin_ is now [available online]({{"/about/bulletin/bulletin.56.2.pdf"|absolute_url}}).

This issue focuses on the community of educators engaging students in HFOSS (Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software) development, including a Member Spotlight on Heidi Ellis, one of the leaders of this community.

There are calls for submissions to the new SIGCSE Virtual conference and the Koli Calling conference, as well as calls for participation in a number of upcoming conferences (RESPECT, ITiCSE, ICER) and a recap of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.

We hope you enjoy it!  And please contact us if you have ideas for contributions to future issues.
