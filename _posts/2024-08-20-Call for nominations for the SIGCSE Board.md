Every three years ACM holds elections for seven positions on the SIGCSE Executive Board which oversees the entire SIGCSE organization, namely Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and three at-large members. The previous SIGCSE Chair serves on each Executive Board as the Immediate Past Chair. A description of each position is found in the SIGCSE by-laws: <https://sigcse.org/policies/bylaws.html>. To hold a Board position, one must be a professional member of both ACM and SIGCSE. If you are unsure of your current membership status, see <https://www.acm.org/membership/myacm-at-a-glance> for information on how to check your status.
 
The SIGCSE election committee invites nominations of professional members of ACM and SIGCSE for the positions. The term of elected service is July 2025 through June 2028, and nominations should be received by the end of the day October 1, 2024, AOE and should be sent to <adrienne@buffalo.edu>.
 
The nomination should include:

* (If not a self-nomination): The name of the nominator, nominator’s institutional affiliation (or indication that there is none), email address, and relationship to the nominee
* Candidate name, institutional affiliation (or indication that there is none), and email address
* Identification of the particular position(s), if any, for which the candidate wishes to be considered
* A curriculum vitae
* A statement of prior, current, and planned involvement in SIGCSE and/or other organizations related to computing education. Please include information about involvement with the SIGCSE organization at large as well as roles in conferences or other programs sponsored by SIGCSE or other computing education organizations
* A brief statement (1500 characters maximum) indicating how the candidate intends to contribute to the SIGCSE Board and the global SIGCSE community if elected
 
The committee would like to see an election slate of candidates that represents the diversity of the SIGCSE membership and the global computing education community at large with broad representation of geography, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and institutional type. We expect nominees to have evidence of engagement with the SIGCSE community and/or the larger computing education community. Self-nominations are highly encouraged, and all nominations will be treated confidentially.
 
Please contact any member of the committee if you have questions.
