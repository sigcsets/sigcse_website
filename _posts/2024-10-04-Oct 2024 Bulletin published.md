The October 2024 (Volume 56, Issue 4) of SIGCSE _Bulletin_ is now [available online]({{"/about/bulletin/bulletin.56.4.pdf"|absolute_url}}).

This issue includes a discussion of the first SIGCSE Virtual conference, which will take place in December (hope to see you there!), as well as a recap of this year’s ITiCSE conference and invitations to attend Koli Calling (in November) and to submit to SIGCSE-TS (there’s still time — the second round deadline is October 14).  We wrap up with a Member Spotlight focusing on the work of Bruce Scharlau on teaching team collaboration.

We are deeply saddened by the passing of Brett Becker, and we plan to include a tribute to him in the January issue.  If you knew Brett and would like to contribute some thoughts and words about him, please contact us.

Yours truly —

Julie Smith and Charles Wallace, SIGCSE Bulletin Co-Editors
