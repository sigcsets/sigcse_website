Our Vice Chair Dr. Brett Becker passed away suddenly at home in Dublin, Ireland on 30th September 2024. As a Board and a community, we are deeply saddened by this loss.  Brett was a sincere, loyal and universally respected member of the Computer Science Education community. He attended ITiCSE 2016 in Peru and often said “he found his community”.  Brett went on to collaborate with many SIGCSE members, been a keynote speaker at international conferences and received a number of awards recognising his standing in the community.  He was the first chair of the ACM Global Computing Education conference and instrumental in its ongoing success.

Details of memorials to Brett will be announced in due course.


Alison Clear, SIGCSE Chair, on behalf of the SIGCSE Board
