The SIGCSE Board has announced a grant scheme to support participation in Working Groups at SIGCSE conferences. The Working Group Travel grant will be available for new Working Group participants at ITiCSE 2025.   The aim of the grant is to encourage participation in working groups from countries and regions where there have been traditionally very few participants. See [WG Travel Grants](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/working-group-travel-grants/) for more information.
