    <p>Each of the following publications are available free to SIGCSE members in the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm">ACM Digital Library</a>:</p>
<ul><li>
<em><a href="http://inroads.acm.org/">ACM Inroads</a></em> (2010 to present) quarterly magazine:
</li>
<ul><li>"Paving the Way Toward Excellence in Computing Education"</li>
<li>The consistent high quality of <em>inroads</em> (see <em>SIGCSE Bulletin</em> below) led to the approval by the ACM Publications Board for SIGCSE to transition <em>inroads</em> to ACM magazine status beginning in 2010.
</li>
<li>SIGCSE sponsors <em>Inroads</em>, pays for it, produces it, and profits from it. It will include a “SIGCSE Corner” in each issue. A subscription is included as a member benefit. However, the ACM Publications Board “controls” <em>Inroads</em>, for example they appoint the editors.
