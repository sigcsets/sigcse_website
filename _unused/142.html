    <p><em>Note: “SIGCSE Global” was a temporary name for this conference. The conference has now been named ACM Global Computing Education Conference, with a short name of CompEd.</em></p>
<p>ACM Global Computing Education Conference (CompEd) is SIGCSE’s new, fourth conference.  This conference will be held starting in 2019 for initially three offerings and will run every other year. In general, the conference should run in countries where we do not regularly hold SIGCSE conferences, so not in North America or Europe. </p>
<p>The first ACM Global Computing Education Conference will be held in Chengdu, China May 17-19, 2019. The website is <a href="http://www.acmcomped.org/">here.</a></p>
<p>We are considering a site in India for the second offering. There is some flexibility on holding the conference at different times of the year, as long as it is not too close to one of our other conferences. The language of the conference will be English.</p>

<p><strong>Proposing a ACM Global Computing Education Conference Location</strong></p>
<p>ACM Global Computing Education Conference will be hosted by universities whose computing faculty are committed to the improvement of computing education. SIGCSE seeks proposals from universities interested in hosting ACM Global Computing Education Conference. The conference takes place any time during the year, but at least 6 weeks away from one of SIGCSE’s other conference.<br /><a href="../events/global/hostGlobal.html">More information</a>.</p>
