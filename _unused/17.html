<p>Since 2003 SIGCSE has awarded a limited number of Special Projects Grants each year. These grants help SIGCSE members investigate and introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of computing. Projects must provide some clear benefit to the wider disciplinary community in the form of new knowledge, developing or sharing of a resource, or good practice in learning, teaching, or assessment.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the awards from June 2018 till today. <a href="#list">Click here</a> for a full list of previous years.</p>
<h4>June, 2018</h4>
<h3>CS Identity Development Interview Project</h3>
<p>* <a href="../files/documents/pdfs/SpecialProjectReports/SP-interim-report-2019-kapoor.pdf">Interim project report</a></p>
<p>Amanpreet Kapoor (<a href="mailto:kapooramanpreet@ufl.edu">kapooramanpreet@ufl.edu</a>)<br />
Christina Gardner-McCune<br />
University of Florida<br />
Award:  $3,078<br />
Award date: June, 2018</p>
<p>This project focuses on the development of professional identity in computer science students.  Drs. Kapoor and Gardner-McCune will identify ways in which computer science students engage in communities of practice and will measure the amount of time students spend in professional experiences outside the classroom.  The impact of these experiences on the development of professional identity will be explored through a qualitative study.  The results of the study will include profiles of successful students and recommendations for faculty.</p>
<h3>Developing a Serious Game to Reinforce Introductory Programming Concepts</h3>

Award:  $5,000<br />
Award date: June, 2018<br />
Report: <a href="../files/documents/pdfs/SpecialProjectReports/SP-interim-report-2018-Kletenik.pdf">Interim Report</a></p>
<p>Drs. Kletenik and Sturm will create a game to introduce programming concepts to undergraduate students.  The game will include a storyline, sound effects, graphics, power-ups and short quiz-like challenges.  It will provide students with an opportunity to practice their programming skills.  The game is intended for a broad audience; gamers and non-gamers, females and underrepresented groups will be consulted during the creation of the game.  In addition, a wide-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of the game will be performed.  The game will be available as a WebGL and will be playable in a browser without downloading or installation.  It will be released under a Free Software license, enabling others to modify the game if so desired.</p>
<h3>Developing and Testing Activities Introducing Elementary School Students to Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>David Touretzky (<a href="mailto:dst@cs.cmu.edu">dst@cs.cmu.edu</a>)<br />
Carnegie Mellon University<br />
Award:  $4,440<br />
Award date: June, 2018</p>
<p>Dr. Touretzky will develop hands-on activities designed to introduce elementary school children to artificial intelligence concepts.  Activities will include topics such as computer vision, face and voice recognition, speech generation, navigation and robotics. The project will include twice-weekly instruction for over 300 elementary school children during academic year 2018-2019.   Learning outcomes and student interest in AI will be measured.  In addition, PowerPoint slides and supplementary materials will be developed for the classroom teachers.  Materials will be cataloged in a resource directory supported by the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA).</p>
