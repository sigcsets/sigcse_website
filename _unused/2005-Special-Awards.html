<p>Since 2003 SIGCSE has awarded a limited number of Special Projects Grants each year. These grants help SIGCSE members investigate and introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of computing. Projects must provide some clear benefit to the wider disciplinary community in the form of new knowledge, developing or sharing of a resource, or good practice in learning, teaching, or assessment.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the awards given in 2005.</p>
<h3>Programming External RAM via a PC Parallel Port</h3>
<p>David Heise (<a href="mailto:dheise@ccis.edu">dheise@ccis.edu</a>)<br />
Columbia College<br />
Award: $2,000<br />
Award Date: March 2005</p>
<p>This project will create the hardware and software tools for Computer Architecture students to load programs onto the processor they construct for the course from a PC parallel port, obviating the tedious process of programming machine code using switches.</p>
<h3>Software Architecture Improvement through Test-driven Development: An Empirical Study</h3>
<p>David Janzen (<a href="mailto:DJANZEN@bethelks.edu">DJANZEN@bethelks.edu</a>)<br />
Bethel College<br />
Award: $4,635<br />
Award Date: May 2005</p>
<p>Test-driven development promises to improves software through both design and testing. This project will perform a series of empirical studies that will examine the efficacy of test-driven development, explore its place in the undergraduate curriculum, and evaluate an educational approach called test-driven learning.</p>
<h3>Training to Persist in Computing Careers</h3>
<p>Kristi Honaker (<a href="mailto:pace_nsf@vt.edu">pace_nsf@vt.edu</a>)<br />
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University<br />
Award: $4,900<br />
Award Date: July 2005</p>
<p>We will develop a Career Resilience toolkit and training module designed to help students cope with computing career stressors. The project's ultimate goal is to retain minority computing students by encouraging the development of soft skills and coping strategies. The toolkit will include step-by-step modules SIGCSE members can facilitate.</p>
<h3>A Course on Ethical Issues in Computing Linking Students at Villanova University and Universidade Nova de Lisboa</h3>
<p>William Fleishmann (<a href="mailto:william.fleischman@villanova.edu">william.fleischman@villanova.edu</a>)<br />
Award date: August 2005</p>
<h3>Designing and Evaluating Programs in Computer Science Education</h3>
<p>Justus Randolph (<a href="mailto:justus.randolph@cs.joensuu.fi">justus.randolph@cs.joensuu.fi</a>)<br />
Award date: August 2005</p>
<h3>Creating a Disciplinary Commons in Computer Science Through the use of Course Portfolios</h3>
<p>Josh Tenenberg (<a href="mailto:jtenenbg@u.washington.edu">jtenenbg@u.washington.edu</a>)<br />
University of Washington, Tacoma<br />
Award: $4,990<br />
Award date: August 2005</p>
<p>The Portfolio Commons involves the collaborative production and peer review of course portfolios by faculty teaching at both 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities in western Washington state. The goals are<br />
to document and share knowledge about student learning in CS and to improve the quality of CS teaching by incorporating scholarly practices for making teaching public, peer-reviewed, and amenable for future use<br />
and development by other CS educators.</p>
<h3>Seeing the Coding Process: Increasing Novice program Development Skills through Video Enhanced Case Studies</h3>
<p>Simon Gray (<a href="mailto:SGRAY@wooster.edu">SGRAY@wooster.edu</a>)<br />
Award date: November 2005</p>
<h3>Creating a SIGCSE Presence in the Former Soviet Union</h3>
<p>John Impagliazzo (<a href="mailto:John.Impagliazzo@hofstra.edu">John.Impagliazzo@hofstra.edu</a>)<br />
Award date: November 2005</p>
<h3>First International Workshop on Phenomography in Computing Education Research</h3>
<p>Raymond Lister (<a href="mailto:raymond@it.uts.edu.au">raymond@it.uts.edu.au</a>)<br />
Anders Berglund<br />
Award date: November 2005</p>
<h3>Knowledge Construction of Abstract Concepts in Introductory Computer Science</h3>
<p>Tim Yuen (<a href="mailto:tyuen@mail.utexas.edu">tyuen@mail.utexas.edu</a>)<br />
Award date: November 2005</p>
<h3>A Methodological Review of Computer Science Research 2000 - 2005</h3>
<p>Justus Randolph (<a href="mailto:justus.randolph@cs.joensuu.fi">justus.randolph@cs.joensuu.fi</a>)<br />
Award date: December 2005</p>
<h3>Accessible Software Engineering for the Visually Impaired (ASEVI)</h3>
<p>Stephanie Ludi (<a href="mailto:salvse@rit.edu">salvse@rit.edu</a>)<br />
Award date: December 2005</p>
