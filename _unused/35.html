    <p>Since 2005 SIGCSE has run a Speaker's Fund program (formerly known as the   Outreach Grant program). The SIGCSE Speaker's Fund supports the dissemination of outstanding SIGCSE/ITiCSE/ICER presentations to other venues. The program is open to any non-ACM conference holding "In-Cooperation" status with SIGCSE. Conference organizers may apply for funds to bring one or more speakers from recent SIGCSE, ITiCSE, or ICER conferences to the meeting to repeat their presentations. Although we expect most proposals will be for paper presentations, we will also consider support for other types of presentations, such as panels or workshops. Expansion of previous presentations, for example from a 30 minute presentation to a 60 minute presentation, is also appropriate.</p>
