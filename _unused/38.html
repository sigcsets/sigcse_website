    <p><strong>Charter Approved: February 24, 2004</strong><br /><strong>Facilitators:  Gloria Childress Townsend, DePauw University and Paula Gabbert, Furman University</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />
This Committee is patterned after a valuable and on-going collaboration between <a href="http://www.acm.org/women/">ACM-W</a> and SIGGRAPH and the Grace Hopper of Women in Computing (GHC).  With this SIGCSE Committee, ACM-W seeks to build a third community within the SIGCSE domain.  Already, ACM-W (and ACM) completely funds an ACM-W member or two to attend SIGGRAPH and GHC (and SIGCSE), to staff a booth and to organize a Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session.</p>
<p>Currently, members of SIGGRAPH may visit an ACM-W booth, an associated BOF session, or both.  They may also join a listserv that is set up and maintained by ACM. The SIGGRAPH activities are necessarily different from those of SIGCSE, so they are not discussed here.  They do, however, provide a useful model in which ACM-W has successfully built a relationship with SIGGRAPH through ACM-W funding and SIGGRAPH cooperation.  </p>
<p>This initiative is a partnership with ACM-W, the ACM Committee on Women in Computing. ACM-W celebrates, informs and supports women in computing, and works with the ACM-W community of computer scientists, educators, employers and policy makers to improve working and learning environments for women. Current initiatives include the ACM-W Student Chapters, the Grace Hopper Conference for Women in Computing and more.

<p><strong>SIGCSE Committee Charge</strong><br />
This SIGCSE Committee on  Expanding the Women-in-Computing Community will have two basic foci:</p>
<ul><li>
developing a document identifying best practices for "recruiting and retaining women in computing" (R&amp;R) and highlighting success stories regarding R&amp;R, and
</li>
<li>
fostering communication with interested computing educators related to expanding the community of women in computing.
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Initial Planning</strong><br />
While the SIGCSE Committee will need to consider various ways to accomplish its goals, several preliminary ideas seem promising:</p>
<ul><li>
During SIGCSE 2004, 2005 and 2006, this committee, with funding from ACM-W, will develop and staff a booth to attract interested visitors to the SIGCSE listserv SIGCSE-WOMEN-COMM and BOFs.
</li>
<li>
The Committee might use the existing SIGCSE structure for Birds-of-a-Feather sessions.  (With ACM-W funding, the Committee might pay for reserving a room to conduct a BOF at SIGCSE 2004.) During a BOF session, the Committee could collect best practices  and success stories related to its charge from the discussants.
</li>
<li>
The Committee could duplicate BOF activities and propose other sessions at SIGCSE 2005.
</li>
<li>
Between SIGCSE 2004 and SIGCSE 2005, the Committee could build its document that describes best practices for R&amp;R - though the Committee's listserv SIGCSE-WOMEN-COMM.
</li>
<li>
The Committee could refine and expand materials between SIGCSE 2005 and SIGCSE 2006.
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Desired Product and its Dissemination</strong><br />
A priority of this Committee is to develop a best-practices report concerning the recruitment and retaining of women in computing. Tentatively, a target date for the completion of this report is 2005.</p>
<p>Assuming the Committee does indeed complete its work on a best-practices document in 2005, then a priority for 2006 would include dissemination.</p>
<ul><li>
SIGCSE 2006 could provide a natural venue for dissemination.
</li>
<li>
The SIGCSE listserv, ACM-W Web pages, and SIGCSE Web pages could provide additional outlets.
</li>
<li>
Publication involving the SIGCSE Bulletin <i>inroads</i> could be considered.
