<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
SIGCSE will award up to five grants per year to defray travel expenses of faculty attending the annual SIGCSE Symposium. Travel Grant award winners will receive complimentary Symposium registration plus up to $500 towards travel expenses. We are particularly interested in encouraging attendance by new faculty and/or faculty who have never been able to attend previously.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
The SIGCSE Board gratefully acknowledges former Board chair Henry Walker for his efforts in establishing this grant program and for his generous donation which served as the impetus to get the program started.  With this beginning, the SIGCSE Board gave its enthusiastic support, and agreed to waive the Symposium registration fee for grant recipients. Further contributions by SIGCSE members have expanded the funding available for additional grants.
