    <p>Since 1998, SIGCSE has sponsored a Doctoral Consortium (DC) with three main goals:</p>
<ul><li>To offer a friendly forum for students to discuss their work and receive constructive feedback.</li>
<li>To offer relevant information on issues important to doctoral candidates.</li>
<li>To nurture a community of researchers.</li>
</ul><p>The DC is designed primarily for Ph.D students in computing-related areas who are planning a career in academia. Students whose research focus is related to computing education are a primary focus, although doctoral students in any computing-related area are welcome to apply.</p>
