<p>Since 2003 SIGCSE has awarded a limited number of Special Projects Grants each year. These grants help SIGCSE members investigate and introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of computing. Projects must provide some clear benefit to the wider disciplinary community in the form of new knowledge, developing or sharing of a resource, or good practice in learning, teaching, or assessment.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the awards given in 2011.</p>
<h3>Learning About Network Security Threats in a Safe, Easy Sandbox</h3>
<p>Michael Jipping (<a href="mailto:jipping@hope.edu">jipping@hope.edu</a>)<br />
Award: $5,000<br />
Award Date: November 2011</p>
<p>This proposal describes a project to create exercises that allow demonstration<br />
of network security threats.  The exercises will be easy to set up and<br />
demonstrate and will be usable to experimentation.  Virtual machines will be<br />
preconstructed for scripted setup and execution.</p>
<h3>Robotics Training for Rural and Urban Middle School Teachers</h3>
<p>Jeff Gray (<a href="mailto:gray@cs.ua.edu">gray@cs.ua.edu</a>)<br />
Award: $2,500<br />
Award Date: August 2011</p>
<p>We have 30 existing robots that we plan to loan to rural and inner-city schools<br />
throughout the state of Alabama. This Special Project would provide the travel<br />
to support the weekend training of 15 teachers. Additionally, the project would<br />
supply the plaques and awards for our state-wide K-12 robotics contest.</p>
<h3>Teaching HS Computer Science as if the Rest of the World Existed</h3>
<p>Scott Portnoff (<a href="mailto:srp4379@lausd.net">srp4379@lausd.net</a>)<br />
Award: $2,500<br />
Award Date: August 2011</p>
<p>Design, Implementation and Rationale for a HS CS Curriculum of Interdisciplinary<br />
Central-Problem-Based (ICPB) Units that Model Real-World Applications. Units<br />
address the complexities of solving central problems in the fields of Astronomy,<br />
Molecular Modeling, Political Science (Voting), Environmental Science,<br />
Bioinformatics/Evolution, Music, and Ethics/Holocaust Studies.</p>
<h3>Managing Student Deliverables in a Collaborative Online Game Design Course</h3>
<p>Ursula Wolz (<a href="mailto:wolzu@montclair.edu">wolzu@montclair.edu</a>)<br />
Award: $2,500<br />
Award Date: August 2011</p>
<p>Game design is a means to motivate students to pursue coursework in computer<br />
science. Since teacher expertise is sparse, a solution is to create online<br />
courses. This project pilots effective transfer of a highly collaborative<br />
pedagogy with a paper-based student deliverables procedure to a fully online<br />
experience.</p>
