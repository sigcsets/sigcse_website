<p>We are up to 2017 and the 48th Technical Symposium was held March 8-11 in Seattle, Washington.  The Conference Chairs were Michael E. Caspersen (Aarhus University) and Stephen Edwards (Virginia Tech).  The Program Chairs were Tiffany Barnes (North Carolina State University) and Dan Garcia (University of California Berkeley).  The SIGCSE 2017 conference theme—Inspire, Innovate, Improve!—highlights our aim to inspire computing educators to innovate new teaching strategies, and to improve those strategies by engaging in the self-reflection and evaluation necessary to deliver the best possible learning outcomes for all. This year we recognizedf a new category of the top 25% of accepted papers as “Exemplary papers”, highlighted by the Program Chairs for their accomplishment of high quality, novelty and broad appeal to reviewers. The Program Chairs also selected three best papers, that each received at least 2 of the highest rankings from reviewers. The Best CS Education Research Paper is “Computing with CORGIS: Diverse, Real-world Datasets for Introductory Computing” by Austin Bart, Ryan Whitcomb, Dennis Kafura, Cliff Shaffer and Eli Tilevich. The Best New Program Paper is “Infrastructure for Continuous Assessment of Retained Relevant Knowledge” by Kathleen Timmerman and Travis Doom. The Best Experience Report Paper is “Making Noise: Using Sound-Art to Explore Technological Fluency” by Erik Brunvand and Nina McCurdy. There were 348 paper submitted and 105 were accepted (30% acceptance rate).   There were 1414 attendees!  Here are the full submission statistics:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/48thTS-statistics.jpg" alt="48thTS-statistics" /></p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was given to Gail Chapman for long term impact on computer science education through the creation of curriculum, teacher professional development, and fierce advocacy for social equity in all computing classrooms.</p>
<p>The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to Mats Daniels for more than two decades of dedicated service to computing education research, building and supporting the international network of computing educators.

<p>The 22nd ITiCSE conference was held in Bologna, Italy on July 3-5, 2017.  The Conference Co-Chairs were Renzo Davoli (University of Bologna) and Michael Goldweber (Xavier University). The Program Co-Chairs were Guido Rößling (Technische Universität Darmstadt) and Irene Polycarpou (University of Central Lancashire). The conference continues to be a truly international conference with 241 submissions with a total of 554 authors from 40 countries on all continents: the authors came from Africa (5), Asia (33), Europe (232), the Middle East (11), North America including Central America and the Caribbean (189), Oceania (34), and South America (50). A total of 175 papers, one panel, 31 posters, 18 tips &amp; techniques and 16 working groups were submitted. This year, 56 papers (32%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings along with 24 posters, 9 Tips and Techniques and 9 accepted working groups.  There were 228 attendees.</p>
<p>The 11th ICER conference was held August 18-20, 2017 in Tacoma, Washington. The General Chairs were Josh Tenenberg and Donald Chinn (both from University of Washington Tacoma), Judy Sheard (Monash University), and Lauri Malmi (Aalto University).

<p>One thing I've neglected to mention about the ICER conference is the Works In Progress Workshop co-located with ICER.  This was started in 2014 as the Critical Research Review and was chaired by Colleen Lewis (Harvey Mudd College).  Somewhat like a Doctoral Consortium for faculty, it has been held every year since and is now a permanent part of the ICER program.</p>
<p>The 21st Doctoral Consortium was co-located with ICER and held on August 17, 2017.  Leading the efforts were Ben Shapiro (University of Colorado, Boulder) and Jan Vahrenhold (University of Münster). There were 20 participants.</p>

<p>The Bulletin (Vol. 48, No. 2, April 2016) contained an article by Michael Casperson explaining the "Improved Reviewing Process for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium". Most conferences have a Program Committee (PC) with personally invited members (typically in the range of 25--50 people). The setup for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium is radically different with a huge pool of ∼1,000 volunteers serving as reviewers.</p>

<p>The theme of the symposium was "The Changing Face of Computing". For the first time at SIGCSE, there was a movie shown following the Thursday night reception, "CODEBREAKER" (<a href="http://www.turingfilm.com">www.turingfilm.com</a>). The movie describes the remarkable and tragic story of Alan Turing, one of the 20th century's most important people. The Executive Producer of this drama-documentary participated in a Q&amp;A session following the movie. A very popular feature of recent Technical Symposiums, the "puzzle extravaganza" started this year.</p>

<p>Since 2008, the ICER Fool's Award has been given for the paper with the most interesting idea and/or most potential for impact on CS education and CS Education research. This year's winners were Orni Meerbaum-Salant, Michal Armoni, and Mordechai (moti) Ben-Ari for their paper Learning Computer Science Concepts with Scratch. Among other things, the paper introduces the idea of integrating the SOLO taxonomy and Bloom's taxonomy as orthogonal taxonomies. Most people in the audience were captured by the idea, which seems very promising and useful. Picture of author in viking hat with horns.</p>
<p>The 14th Doctoral Consortium was held on August 8th in Aarhus with Lauri Malmi (Aalto University) leading the efforts.</p>

<p>Welcome to this final edition of inroads – the SIGCSE Bulletin. This Volume 41, Number 4, 2009 December, issue represents the last time that inroads (with lower case “i”) will be synonymous with the SIGCSE Bulletin. Starting in 2010, the SIGCSE Bulletin will continue with Volume 42, Number 1 as an online newsletter. The “new” SIGCSE Bulletin would contain news items related to SIGCSE and its operations as well as other SIGCSE-related information. Starting in 2010, in addition to the SIGCSE Bulletin, ACM will publish Volume 1, Number 1 of a magazine called ACM Inroads (with upper case “I”). This new ACM magazine will have content similar to inroads as found in this current 2009 December issue. Columnists will continue to contribute to the publication; invited editorials would continue to appear when appropriate.</p>

<p>The 12th Doctoral Consortium was held September 5, 2008 in Sydney when the DC was relocated to be joint with ICER rather than the Technical Symposium.  The leaders of this DC were the same as earlier in the year: Josh Tenenberg (University of Washington, Tacoma) and Donald Joyce (UNITEC Institute of Technology). Thanks for doing double duty!</p>
<p>In Volume 40, Issue 2, June 2008 Inroads issue the discussion of officially transitioning Inroads from “newsletter” to “magazine” began. The Board proposed to: 1. Decouple the conference proceedings from Inroads 2. Elevate Inroads to a "magazine" classification within ACM 3. Elevate the content to include papers of "refereed", "formally reviewed", and "reviewed" status for all four quarterly issues.  The details were outlined in an email to the membership on March 13 and the details were reprinted in the Peripherals section of this issue.</p>
<p>From the same issue, a new set of leaders for ICER were announced to carry on the second 3-year host/leader cycle. Raymond Lister chaired ICER ’08 in Sydney, Australia. His co-chairs were Mike Clancy, the 2009 ICER chair, and Michael Caspersen, the 2010 chair.</p>
<p>Two international chapters of SIGCSE were launched this year – an Australasian chapter and a Spanish chapter.</p>
<p>From Inroads Volume 40, Issue 4, December 2008:  The 2008 year saw us at an all-time high for membership. JERIC transformed into a new publication called Transactions on Computing Education.</p>

<p>The 3rd ICER was held September 15-16, 2007 at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA.  The Conference and Program Chairs were again the original triumvirate: Richard Anderson (University of Washington), Sally Fincher (University of Kent at Canterbury), and Mark Guzdial (Georgia Institute of Technology).  There were 24 papers submitted with 14 accepted for a 58% acceptance rate.  There were 71 attendees that second year.</p>
<p>In the June 2007 (Volume 39, Number 2) Issue of Inroads, outgoing Chair Henry Walker wrote a wonderful summary of the organization.  Here are a few highlights:</p>
<ul><li>For many years up to 2001, SIGCSE had the highest retention rate of any Special Interest Group (SIG) within the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). However, SIGCSE was attracting relatively few new members -- even fewer than the small number leaving. Put together, SIGCSE had 1908 members at the end of fiscal year 2001, after experiencing a decade-long period of gradual decline in membership. This placed SIGCSE as the ninth largest of approximately 34 SIGs. In 2001, the Board changed directions to strongly encourage conference participants to join SIGCSE through the strategic setting of registration rates. The expectation was that many new members would seek to retain their membership -- if only we could get them started. Additional efforts to increase member involvement and expand recruitment are discussed below. Although the impact of specific initiatives is difficult to assess, the organization seemed to be connecting well with many in the computing community. At the end of the 2006 fiscal year SIGCSE has 2587 members, an increase of about 35% over 2001, and now ranked as the 4th largest SIG (just overtaking SIG PLAN by 27 members in 2006).
</li><li>In April, the conference leadership for SIGCSE 2010 was announced and current SIGCSE members were invited to volunteer to be part of future program committees. Within 35 hours, 21 SIGCSE members had volunteered -- a wonderful testament to the interest of our membership in the SIGCSE organization!
</li><li>The Symposium and ITiCSE showed good growth:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/38thTS-statistics.jpg" alt="38thTS-statistics" /></li><li>The SIGCSE Board raised annual dues from $17 to $25 in 1999, and dues continue at that level today (for an electronic membership). This fee is consciously set to attract members, but (alas) it does not fully cover members costs. To balance budgets, SIGCSE traditionally has relied on achieving a surplus on the annual symposium. In many earlier years, symposia could achieve a profit of $25,000 or so, through the diligence and extraordinary efforts of conference leadership. More recently, the symposia have become extremely successful with exhibitors, particularly with the efforts of our exhibit management companies. At the same time, we plan both the ITiCSE and ICER conferences to break even, and sometimes a ITiCSE conference makes as much as a $10,000. With careful stewardship and with the resounding success of symposia and their exhibits, SIGCSE finances have progressed remarkably since 2001. For example, in 2001, SIGCSE's Fund Balance (reserve accounts with ACM) was $184,153.01; and ACM required a significant fraction of this to be held in reserve to cover cash flow for conferences. SIGCSE was in a solid financial position, but its reserves were only about 60% of annual conference expenses and receipts. With on-going careful stewardship and significant revenues from symposia exhibits, SIGCSE's Fund Balance at the end of the 2006 fiscal year was $438,699.04 -- an increase of about 138% since 2001. This level of financial expense has greatly exceeded expectations -- but it also has allowed the SIGCSE Board to keep registration fees for SIGCSE symposia relatively low while expanding SIGCSE programs and activities.
</li><li>Special Projects: In 2002, through the vision of Sally Fincher and others, SIGCSE initiated a program of Special Projects Grants “to support members who wish to investigate and introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of computing.” Grants are possible up to $5,000 USD per proposal, and successful recipients are expected to present their results at a SIGCSE conference.
 </li>
<p>In that same issue, Inroads published eleven papers on the topic of Computer and Human Error (CHE). CHE opens a new area of computing. We have all experienced computer human errors and now people are researching and addressing this new area. I am delighted to share these CHE works with you.</p>
<p> The December 2007 (Volume 39, Issue 4) Inroads premiered a new cover for this and future publications. Slightly more graphic introductory pages were also introduced as we moved toward modern times.<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/InroadsDecember2007.jpg" alt="InroadsDecember2007" /></p>
<p>That same issue included an Invited Editorial from Bill Manaris (College of Charleston) reflecting on possible contributions to the falling enrollments in computer science. How different from today!</p>
<p>Finally, here's part of poem, " An Ode to Computing Educators at SIGCSE" by Tony Clear. It was recited to the SIGCSE award recipients at a dinner in Covington, Kentucky, March 8, 2007:</p>
<p>SIGCSE a group of fine people<br />
Scholars who share humanity<br />
Through their love of others<br />
Love for learning<br />
And love of teaching.<br />
No matter what their age,<br />
Through firm personal conviction,<br />
Mentoring life long learning.</p>
<p>Knowing that<br />
To truly learn</p>
<p>First<br />
Must come<br />
Or be developed</p>
<p>The thirst.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>Blessed are those who thirst<br />
But even more so<br />
Blessed are the thirst makers.</p>

</p><p>In Volume 36, Issue 2, June 2004 issue of The Bulletin, Chair Henry Walker wrote the following, most of which is still true today:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SIGCSE Board formally approves event sites. For ITiCSE, interested SIGCSE members initiate proposals for holding conferences at their universities in Europe, and SIGCSE representatives .. work with local leaders to refine site details. In contrast, SIGCSE chooses locations for its symposia in the US through a bidding process, coordinated by ACM staff and a SIGCSE volunteer. For all events, the SIGCSE Board devotes considerable attention to finding appropriate facilities at costs that seem within reach of SIGCSE members. Unfortunately, this eliminates many initial proposals (particularly from hotels and convention centers at numerous well-known cities in the United States).</p></blockquote>

The conference activities were extended to Saturday, as many attendees requested in the past. The SIGCSE Town Meeting was held on Saturday morning, is a new event this year which gave everyone an opportunity to express their thoughts on the future of computing education. The student poster competition became part of the official program and specific events for first time attendees of the conference were held to ensure that they feel the camaraderie of the SIGCSE community. Workshops and posters were also published (<a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/280000/274790/bm/backmatter.pdf?ip=174.74.49.67"> https://portalparts.acm.org/280000/274790/bm/backmatter.pdf?ip=174.74.49.67</a>).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the day before the conference officially began, the first ever Doctoral Consortium was held. Vicki Almstrum (University of Texas at Austin) and Marian Petre (Open University) ran the first DC. The aims of the Doctoral Consortium were:</p>
<ul><li>To offer a friendly forum for students to discuss their work and receive constructive feedback.
</li><li>To offer relevant information on issues important to doctoral candidates.
</li><li>To nurture a community of researchers.
</li></ul><p>The Consortium was designed for Ph.D. students in any area of Computing who plan to have a career in academia. All participants gave short presentations of their research ideas or ongoing research. Small group discussions, a round-table discussion, and presentations by specialists in the field allowed participants to exchange ideas, explore relevant issues, discuss strategies for completion, and prepare for the challenges of an effective career in higher education. Some notable attendees of that first Doctoral Consortium included Anders Berglund, Christina Björkman, and Mats Daniels (Uppsala University), Lisa Kaczmarczyk (Chemeketa Community College), and Laurie Williams (University of Utah).</p>
<p>The 3rd ITiCSE was held at Dublin City University in Ireland, in cooperation with SIGCUE and in conjunction with the 6th Annual Conference on the Teaching of Computing.

From Volume 30 Issue 2, June 1998: "SIGCSE has renewed its cooperation with NECC, but in a limited capacity. NECA, the coordinating group for NECC, changed its bylaws to permit organizational members in a non-voting capacity. We have chosen to join in this way. It means that we still can participate in NECC planning, while not being required to provide sessions or speakers. … The SIGCSE email distribution list has more than 600 recipients and traffic is quite heavy at times."  In addition, the Working Group reports from ITiCSE were published in the December 1998 issue of Inroads.</p>

<p>The other keynote at the Technical Symposium that year was presented by John A.N. Lee:  "The Forgotten Tool of Computer Science Education--History". Other interesting facts about the 1996 Technical Symposium (thanks to John Impagliazzo): </p>
<ul><li>It was the Launch of ACM 50th anniversary.</li>
<li>Extended workshops to Sunday morning.</li>
<li>First time BOFs were published in the proceedings.</li>
<li>Featured a chess match between Kasparov and IBM Deep Blue.</li>
<li>The reception on Thursday night featured carving stations and classical music  - harp,  violin,  and piano.</li>
</ul><p>There were also some unexpected difficulties associated with the Symposium.  A snow storm disrupted arrivals on Thursday and Friday.  On Tuesday, Symposium Chair John Impagliazzo was notified that Vice President Al Gore was to do the symbolic start of the ENIAC.  We were told to evacuate three floors at the Marriott Wednesday and Thursday without alternative housing for SIGCSE people. Panic mode set in!  Fortunately, Al Gore cancelled Wednesday morning. Phew! John shared his hotel room with others due to flight cancellations because of the snow.  And Nell Dale had her first snowball fight with John, and won :-)</p>
<p>The proceedings for the conferences actually took up 2 issues of The Bulletin (Volume 23, Issue 1, March 1996) for the Technical Symposium Proceedings and Volume 28, Issue Special Issue for the ITiCSE ’96 proceedings which included posters and demonstrations.</p>

<h3><a name="1995" id="1995">1995</a></h3>
<p>The year is 1995 and our Board from 1993 continued as ACM allowed SIG officers to extend their term another 2 years if they wished, without an election.  Our Board all wished to extend:  Chair:  Lillian "Boots" Cassel (Villanova University);  Vice-Chair: G. Michael Schneider (Macalester College); Secretary/Treasurer: Henry Walker (Grinnell College); Board:  Janet Hartman (US Air Force Academy), Margaret Reek (Rochester Institute of Technology) and, J. Paul Myers (Trinity College).  James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued at the Bulletin Editor.</p>
<p>The 26th Technical Symposium was held March 2-4 (3 days!), 1995 in Nashville, TN at the Opryland Hotel Complex.  The Conference Chairs were Cary Laxer (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology) and Frank Young (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology). Yes, that's right they were the program chairs just 2 years earlier!  They must have really enjoyed the job given the fact they signed up again so quickly!  The Program Chair was Judith Gersting (Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis / University of Hawaii at Hilo).  There were 215 papers submitted with 75 accepted (35% acceptance rate) as well as  24 panels and 3 tutorials.</p>
<p>An interesting fact from this Technical Symposium:  SIGCSE members wearing conference badges were constantly accosted by tourists because they thought "ACM" was the Academy of Country Music!</p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was given to <strong>Robert Aiken</strong>, for being an outstanding mentor, advocate of computer science and contributions to technology education both in the United States and abroad.</p>

Additional conference committee members were Carol Barner (Glendale Community College) for Publicity, Dan Joyce (Villanova University) for the Proceedings, John Lewis (Villanova University) was the Treasurer and David C. Platt (Mesa Community College) handled Local Arrangements. </p>
<p>A total of 75 papers were accepted along with 28 panels and 15 posters.  The keynotes were given by Norman E. Gibbs (Carnegie Mellon University) talking about “Computer Science Education:  Past, Present, Future” and William H. Graves (UNC Chapel Hill) spoke on “Learning Productivity: Medium and Message.”</p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was given to Norman Gibbs (Carnegie Mellon University) for his contribution to Software Engineering Education, being the first director of the Software Engineering Institute, and co-founder of the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium.</p>
<p>From Vol 26, Issue 3, Sept. 1994 Bulletin contains the first mention of “electronic messages sent to the SIGCSE members,” the origination of our listserv! </p>

<h3><a name="1993" id="1993">1993</a></h3>
<p>In the elections of 1993, Lillian "Boots" Cassel (Villanova University) was elected Chair, G. Michael Schneider (Macalester College) became Vice-Chair and Henry Walker (Grinnell College) became the Secretary/Treasurer. Elected Board members were Janet Hartman (US Air Force Academy), Margaret Reek (Rochester Institute of Technology) and, J. Paul Myers (Trinity University in San Antonio).  James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued at the Bulletin Editor.</p>
<p>The 24th Technical Symposium was held February 18-19, 1993 in Indianapolis, IN at the Indianapolis Convention Center.  Conference Chair was Bruce J. Klein (Grand Valley State University). Program Chairs were Cary Laxer and Frank Young (both from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology). Panels were overseen by Margaret Reek (Rochester Institute of Technology).  Workshops were handled by G. Michael Schneider (Macalaster College) and Paul Carter (University of British Columbia).  Birds of a Feather were chaired by Kenneth Johnson (Grand Valley State University).  The conference Treasurer was Paul Jorgensen (Grand Valley State University) and Evaluations were done by Paul Leidig (Grand Valley State University).  Anyone else notice the pattern between having a Technical Symposium leadership position and then being elected to the Board?</p>
<p>There were 204 papers submitted and 60 were accepted for 29.4% acceptance rate (!).  There were also 24 panels, 3 tutorials, and 11 workshops.  Because of the increase in submissions, the Board voted to expand the program to add an additional paper track for the following year.</p>
<p>The keynotes that year were given by Alan Kay and Elliot Soloway.  Elliot's talk was entitled “Should Non-CS Majors Learn Programming?”  (How prophetic!)</p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was given to Alan Kay (Apple Computer) for his contributions to Smalltalk programming languages, and research development of computers usable by children.</p>
<p>We might consider this to be the year of addressing female underrepresentation in computing. There were many conference and Bulletin articles on the subject.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a name="1992" id="1992">1992</a></h3>
<p> The 23rd Technical Symposium held March 5-6, 1992 in Kansas City, MO with the theme “Networking for Knowledge.”  The Conference Chair was Maynard J. Mansfield (Indiana University - Purdue University at Fort Wayne).  The Program Chairs were Curt M. White (Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne) and Janet Hartman (Illinois State University Program).  Cary Laxer (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology) headed up the Panels and Ken Modesitt (Western Kentucky University) oversaw Workshops. Larry Cottrell (University of Central Florida) oversaw the Birds of a Feather. Bob Barett (Indiana/Purdue University at Fort Wayne) was the Treasurer and Anne Pierce (Georgia Southern University) handled Evaluations.</p>
<p>There were 60 papers accepted along with 20 panels and 8 posters. There were 702 attendees.</p>
<p>Keynotes were delivered by Daniel D. McCracken (City College of New York) “On Programming Languages in the Computer Science Curriculum” and Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin) “My Vision is Your Vision.”  Other interesting tidbits from this conference:  there were 6 concurrent sessions and the first “official” SIGCSE Social on Thursday night of the conference occurred.  Before this conference it was considered a private party and not part of the official conference program. With this conference it officially became part of the conference.</p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was given to Daniel McCracken, author of numerous best-selling books on Fortran, COBOL and other languages and for their profound influence on current computer science teachers.</p>
<p>You can listen to an interview with Dan through the Computing Educators Oral History Project here: <a href="http://ahab.southwestern.edu/departments/mathcompsci/OHProject/mccrackenD-overview.html"> http://ahab.southwestern.edu/departments/mathcompsci/OHProject/mccrackenD-overview.html</a>.  </p>
<p>The June 1992 issue of The Bulletin (Volume 24, Issue 2) contains information on the 1991 ACM Scholastic Programming Contest Finals (Stanford won). This was the first contest to break the “sneaker-net” barrier (program submissions over a network vs. disks)!</p>
<p>In The December 1992 issue of The Bulletin (Volume 24, Issue 4, doi 10.1145/141837.141838) Chair Nell Dale presents the results of the 6 page membership survey conducted earlier in the year. Interesting to me was that 49% of the responses indicated that SIGCSE should “actively recruit high school teachers who teach APCS.”  The survey also included questions about SIGCSE sponsoring activities outside the US…foreshadowing of the ITiCSE conference!  Also, check out the responses to areas of research:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/1992-research-areas.png" alt=" Logo for 22nd Technical Symposium" /></p>
<p>Another topic brought up in the survey was what SIGCSE could do to add validity to research in Computer Science Education.  Evidence of our growing pains.</p>

<h3><a name="1991" id="1991">1991</a></h3>
<p>Did you know that the current ACM President was once a SIGCSE officer?? Yep!</p>
<p>Elections were held in 1991 and we elected the following:  Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin) was elected Chair, Lillian ("Boots") Cassel (Villanova University) was elected Vice-Chair; and Harriet Taylor (Louisiana State University) was elected Secretary/Treasurer.  Elected Board members were Steve Cunningham (California State University, Stanislaus), Cherri Pancake (Auburn University), and Angela Shiflet (Wofford College).  The Bulletin Editor continued to be James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi). </p>
<p>The 22nd Technical Symposium held March 7-8, 1991 in San Antonio, TX at the San Antonio Convention Center.  The Conference Chair was Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin).  The Program Chairs were John and Laurie Werth (The University of Texas at Austin).   Panels and Special Sessions were chaired by Daniel Canas (Wake Forest University).  Workshops were chaired by Henry Walker (Grinnell College).  Birds of a Feather were chaired by Joyce Brennan (University of Texas at Austin).  Treasurer for the conference was Chris Edmondson-Yurkanan (University of Texas at Austin) and Local Arrangements were handled by Suzy Gallagher (University of Texas at Austin) and J. Paul Myers (Trinity University).<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/22ndTSlogo.png" alt=" Logo for 22nd Technical Symposium" /><br />
There were 175 papers submitted, and 60 accepted for 34.3% acceptance rate. There were 11 panels, 1 special session and 43 posters. Attendance for the conference was 734. </p>
<p>The theme for the conference was “Education, Research, Industry:  Keep the Information Flowing.”  Key notes were given by David Gries (Cornell University) and William Wulf (University of Virginia).</p>
<p>The Friday luncheon was held again, with over 400 people in attendance (Bulletin, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 1991). This article, by out-going chair Elliot Koffman also mentions the growth of the Saturday workshops.  The dues for the following year were increased to $16.50.  SIGCSE Membership was, and still is, a bargain!</p>
<p>In the December, 1991 issue of The Bulletin (Volume 23, Issue 4), new Chair Nell Dale noted that SIGCSE had the highest member retention rate (92%) of any of the ACM SIGs!  SIGCSE had approximately 2600 members. This issue also includes detailed minutes of several Board Meetings.</p>

<h3><a name="1990" id="1990">1990</a></h3>
<p>In 1990 we celebrated the 21st birthday of SIGCSE along with our 21st Technical Symposium.  We celebrated February 22-23 in Washington, DC at the Sheraton Washington Hotel.  The Conference theme was “From Generation to Generation.” The Conference Co-Chairs were Richard H. Austing (University of Maryland) and Lillian N. Cassel (Villanova University).  It was held in conjunction with the ACM CSC (February 20-22) and Post Symposium Workshops were held on February 24th.   The Program Chair was Gayle Yaverbaum (Temple University) for Papers. Harriet Taylor (Louisiana State University) chaired Panels, Tutorials, Case Studies; Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University) chaired Special Events; Donald Gotterbarn (Wichita State) and James Swanson (New Hampshire College) chaired the Birds of a Feather sessions; Dan Joyce (Villanova University) headed up Publications and Local Arrangements were handled by Elizabeth Adams (American University) and Pat Woodworth (Ithaca College).  This is the beginning of our current Conference Committee format.</p>
<p>Here’s part of the advertisement I found in the Bulletin (Volume 21, Issue 4, Dec. 1989):<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinDec1989.jpg" alt="December 1989 Bulletin " /><br />
There were 120 papers submitted, 52 accepted, for a 43.3% acceptance rate.  There were 17 panels, 3 tutorials and 3 workshops listed in the final proceedings.  A total of 756 people attended.  This was the first year of the Friday luncheon – which we’ve had ever since at the Technical Symposium.</p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was given to the <strong>Curriculum '68 Committee</strong> (William F. Atchison, Chair; Samuel D. Conte, John W. Hamblen, Thomas E. Hull, Thomas A. Keenan, William B. Kehl, Edward J. McCluskey, Silvio O. Navarro, Werner C. Rheinboldt, Earl J. Schweppe, William Viavant, David M. Young, Jr.)</p>
<p>For their work on the seminal document leading the way for the founding of a multitude of computer science departments and providing guidance to the formation of courses and production of textbooks.</p>
<p>There were two key notes:  William Atchison gave one entitled “Revisting our Roots:  Curriculum ’68 and Beyond” and Robert M Aiken and James Adams gave one entitled “Coming of Age”.</p>
<p>In the September, 1990 (Volume 22, Issue 3) of The Bulletin, the Karl V. Karlstrom Award for the Outstanding Educator in Computer Science Award was announced.</p>
<p>In the December, 1990 (Volume 22, Issue 4) of The Bulletin, the 1990 ACM Scholastic Programming Contest Finals sponsored by AT&amp;T Computer Systems is highlighted including the winning teams (University of Otago New Zealand won), the computing specifications (each team was provided with its own AT&amp;T 6386 WorkGroup System, only Pascal solutions allowed) and the problems.

<h3><a name="1989" id="1989">1989</a></h3>
<p>It is 1989 and the 20th Technical Symposium (still joint with ACM Computer Science Conference) was held February 21-23 at the Commonwealth Convention Center in Louisville, KY.  The SIGCSE theme was “Racing to the Future”.<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/20thTS.jpg" alt="1989 ACM Computer Science Conference front cover" /><br />
The Conference Chair was John Gorgone (Bentley College). Maynard Mansfield and Robert Barrett (both from Indiana University – Purdue University at Fort Wayne) served as Program Co-Chairs.  John Schrage (Southern Illinois University – Edwardsville) was Chair of Panels; Don Chand (Bentley College) was Chair for Case Studies and Tutorials; Dennis Anderson (Bentley College) was Treasurer; and S. Srinivasan  helped with Local Arrangements.</p>
<p>A total of 181 papers were submitted with 60 accepted (33% acceptance rate) and there were 14 panels and 2 workshops.</p>
<p>The 1989 Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded to <strong>Edsger Dijkstra</strong> for providing clarity about programs through his letter <strong>"GOTO Considered Harmful"</strong> and writings on structured programming and the effects of these works on the emergence of formal methods as integral to computer science education.</p>
<p>There were also elections, but the entire same Board was elected, so they must have been doing an excellent job! Continuing as Chair was Elliot Koffman (Temple University); Vice-Chair was Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin); Secretary/Treasurer was Robert Cupper (Allegheny College). The Board of Directors continued to be: Lillian Cassel (Villanova University), A. Joe Turner (Clemson University), and Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University).</p>
<p>James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued as the Editor of the Bulletin.</p>

<h3><a name="1988" id="1988">1988</a></h3>
<p>The year is 1988 and the 19th Technical Symposium was held in Atlanta, GA at the Westin Peachtree Plaza on February 25-26.  The Conference Chair was Betty Jehn (University of Dayton) and the Program Chair was Herb Dershem (Hope College).  Angela Shiflet (Wofford College) served as the Panels Chair and Verlynda Dobbs (Wright State University) served as the Treasurer for the conference.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown for the submissions for the year:</p>
<p>Papers: 63 accepted, 171 submitted, acceptance rate of 37%. 15 panels accepted 2 tutorials accepted:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/Symposium1988.jpg" alt="Acceptance rates for 1988 Symposium" /></p>
<p>The 1988 Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded to Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper for her pioneering work in compiler design (Cobol), her efforts to oversee the Navy's efforts to maintain uniformity in programming languages over two decades, and a master teacher who reminded us to watch our nanoseconds.</p>
<p>We have this story from Elliot Koffman, then Chair of SIGCSE: </p>
<blockquote><p>I spent an unforgettable morning with Joyce (Little Currie) interviewing Grace Murray Hopper prior to her receiving the SIGCSE award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education. She was unable to attend the meeting to receive the award for health reasons but we played the video tape of the interview and it was very well received.  Many copies of the tape were requested and sent to CS and Info Sci departments after the meeting. </p></blockquote>
<p>Elliot thinks he has a copy of the Grace Murray Hopper interview video, but is unable to get it to eject from his VCR. If someone else has an old copy, please let me know - this is definitely something we would want to transfer to digital to have for posterity!</p>
<p>In the Volume 20, Issue 2, June 1988 Bulletin was a financial report that listed the SIGCSE membership at 2,521 members!</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a name="1987" id="1987">1987</a></h3>
<p>In 1987 the 18th Technical Symposium was held February 19-20 in St. Louis, MO. The Conference Chair was Dan St. Clair (University of Missouri at Rolla Graduate Center). A.K. Rigler (University of Missouri at Rollla) served as Program Chair and Robert A. Barrett (Indiana University Purdue University at Fort Wayne) was the BOF and Special Sessions Chair.  A total of 93 papers were accepted (a big jump from the previous year’s 51!).</p>
<p>The 1987 Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded to <strong> Niklaus Wirth </strong> for the development of a series of programming languages mainly for use in education chief among them Pascal. These languages continue to have a profound effect on the teaching of programming and on computer science in general.</p>
<p>We also held elections. Elected as Chair was Elliot Koffman (Temple University); Vice-Chair was Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin); Secretary/Treasurer was Robert Cupper (Allegheny College). The Board of Directors elected were the same from the previous board: Lillian Cassel (Villanova University), A. Joe Turner (Clemson University), and Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University).</p>
<p>Della Bonnette would have rotated to the Past President position. A quick Google search reveals that she was on a SIGCSE panel in 2000 talking about ABET and is still involved with ABET/CSAB.</p>
<p>James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued as the Editor of the Bulletin.  Sadly, 1987 also marked the end of the “President’s Notes” in the Bulletin which has been the source of a lot of great information!</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a name="1986" id="1986">1986</a></h3>
<p>In 1986 the 17th Technical Symposium was held February 6-7 in Cincinnati, OH at the Clarion Hotel.  The Conference Chair was Richard H. Austing (University of Maryland). The Program Chairs were Joyce Currie Little (Towson State Univ) and Lillian N. Cassel (University of Delaware). Bruce J. and Georgianna T. Klein (Grand Valley State College) served as the Special Sessions Chairs. Over 100 papers were submitted and 51 were accepted.  A fun fact about this Technical Symposium – it included a German Festival!</p>
<p>Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded to <strong>Donald Knuth</strong> for authoring the influential series the "Art of Computer Programming" and his continuing contributions including TeX publication tool. His keynote talk was entitled “Theory and Practice” and was delivered before approximately 1000 attendees of the joint ACM Computer Science / SIGCSE Conference.</p>
<p>Here’s a story about John Impagliazzo’s initial foray into SIGCSE:<br /></p><blockquote>I only got involved with SIGCSE in the mid-1980s when Joyce Currie Little dragged me to the Thursday evening celebration and made me (forced me to) dance with many of the SIGCSE dignitaries (Boots, Della, Nell, Joyce, etc.) at the SIGCSE (German) Symposium in Cincinnati. I happened to sit between Jim Miller (SIGCSE Bulletin EIC) and Nell Dale. The rest is history. Dick Austing had something to do with all this also.</blockquote>
<p>We are thankful those SIGCSE dignitaries roped you in!</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a name="1985" id="1985">1985</a></h3>
<p>In 1985 we elected new officers:  Della Bonnette (University of Southwestern Louisiana) for Chair, Elliott Koffman (Temple University) for Vice-Chair, Robert Cupper (Allegheny College) for Secretary/Treasurer. The At-Large members elected were Lillian Cassel (Goldey Beacom College), A. Joe Turner (Clemson University), and Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University).</p>
<p>James Miller (University of West Florida) continued as Bulletin Editor. Here’s an idea of what submissions were like (from the Volume 17 Issue 2, June 1985 Bulletin):<br /><em>At present most accepted papers are retyped on a word processor. We are attempting to standardize the format to single-spaced, double Column copy in prestige elite typeface, with 10 characters/inch, with 42 characters/line, and with right and left margin justification. Single column format is 89 characters/line.</em><br /><em>We then print them on standard white computer paper and do a "cut-and-paste" layout on camera-ready matte sheets which are photographically reduced 25 percent. … Copy may be typed directly on the sheets and is correctable with Snopake, or you can use cut-and-paste.</em><br /><em>I will ask you to send any graphs, tables, or figures in camera-ready form and to remember that the 25 percent reduction may reduce their effectiveness. Small illustrations may be drawn directly on the matte sheets with a black felt-tipped pen or attached with rubber cement.</em></p>
<p>The 16th Technical Symposium was held March 12-14, 1985 in New Orleans, LA at the Marriott Hotel.  The Conference Chair was Della T. Bonnette (University of Southwest Louisiana).  The Program Chair was Harriet G. Taylor (Louisiana State University) and Nell Dale (University of Texas Austin) served as the Special Sessions Chair.  A total of 68 papers were accepted.  The proceedings are in the first issue of the Bulletin for 1985.  Interesting for me, I think I found the first work on cognition in programming at SIGCSE: </p>
<dl><dt>COGNITIVE PROCESSES IN PROGRAMMING MODERATOR: Laurie Werth (UNLV)</dt>
<dd>This panel will discuss (a) the cognitive processes used in computer programming (b) how to use these processes in teaching computer science. Laurie Werth will introduce the panel members and give a brief background of work in this area. A short review of studies predicting success in beginning computer science classes, as well as copies of two computer science placement examinations, will be available as handouts.<br />
Barry Kurtz (New Mexico State) will briefly describe Piaget's intellectual development levels and a computer science test which he has designed to measure the correspondence between Piaget's levels and success in a beginning programming class. Dave Scanlan (Illinois State) will discuss the differences between right and left brain cognitive abilities and the need for tapping right brain abilities in teaching computer science. Saj-nicole Joni (Yale University) will present a brief overview of the cognitive methodology used in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence research. Using the programming knowledge which has been identified, she will present some ideas on helping novice programmers to correct non-buggy programs. Jeff Bonar (University of Pittsburgh) will discuss cognitive elements in programming which he has measured and then explain a plan-based intelligent tutoring environment which he developed for beginning programmers.</dd>
</dl><p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded to Elliot Organick. He was given the award as the Founder of SIGCSE, author and disseminator of the MULTICS operating system, and author of several widely disseminated textbooks in programming languages and first computer courses.</p>
<p>Here’s another great story from Frank Friedman:<br /></p><blockquote>I am not sure when this happened, but probably the early 80s.  I was the Allegheny Regional Rep to ACM Council when we had several naming discussions for our dear old Association, principally because of concerns that the word Machinery was in the name.  So in my quarterly newsletter to ACM Members in the Allegheny Region and wrote a little blurb about this discussion and asked for member feedback concerning the name.  I got only three responses which right there told me what I needed to know.  But all three responses pretty much asked whether Council had better things to do.  And two of the three changed my name from Frank to Fred.</blockquote>
<p>And that was that.  Now I have two names.</p>
<p>Frank   er, I mean Fred</p>

<h3><a name="1984" id="1984">1984</a></h3>
<p>The 15th Technical Symposium was held February 16-17, 1984 in Philadelphia, PA at the Franklin Plaza Hotel. The Chair was Richard H. Austing (University of Maryland). Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University) served as the Refereed Papers Chair and Lillian N. Cassel (Goldey Beacom College) served as the Special Sessions Chair. There were 94 papers submitted and 36 were accepted (38% acceptance rate). There were 8 panels and 2 special sessions. The conference luncheon featured the awards being given to the winners of the final round of the Eighth Annual International Scholastic Programming Contest and to the second recipient of the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.  The invited speaker at the luncheon was Dr. Gwen Bell of The Computer Museum of Boston.</p>
<p>The conference was held jointly with the CSC and our own Frank Friedman was the General Chairperson of the CSC that year!  According to Frank: “Most of the CSC Committee were women and they were REALLY GOOD people.  They were the brains behind the operation and they did all the work.  I just scheduled meetings, they basically ran the show.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the keynotes for the CSC were also computing education related:</p>
<ul><li>Daniel D. McCracken: A Skeptical View of Computer Literacy
</li><li>Mary Shaw: Goals for Computer Science Education in the 1980's
</li></ul><p>Because Frank was the CSC Chair that year, he was able to provide the following pictures:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/VPIProgrammingTeam.jpg" alt="VPI ProgrammingTeam" /><br />

<p>Unfortunately, I found no record of the recipient of the Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education for 1983. Frank sent this picture of Marshall Yovits presenting Orrin Taulbee with an ACM award, but I don’t think it’s ours:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/1984-4.jpg" alt="Taulbee-ACM Award" /></p>

<h3><a name="1983" id="1983">1983</a></h3>
<p>In February 17-18, 1983 the 14th Technical Symposium was held in Orlando, FL. The Conference Chair was Larry Cottrell (University of Central Florida). The Program Chairs were A. Joe Turner (Clemson University) and Sheau-Dong Lang (University of Central Florida).   There were 84 papers submitted with 59 accepted, yielding a 70.2% acceptance rate.</p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded to Karl Karlstrom (Prentice-Hall) for being a book editor who piloted some 500 books on computer science through the publication process at a time when a senior editor said, "I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a fad that won't last out the year." If you want to read his remarks, check out the June 1983 issue of the Bulletin <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382188"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382188</a>.  This issue also contains the 1983 International Programming Contest problems.</p>

<p>James Miller (University of West Florida) began his first of eight terms as the Bulletin Editor.</p>
<p>On February 11-12, 1982 the 13th Technical Symposium was held in Indianapolis, IN.  The Conference Chair was John Dalphin, (Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne). The Program Chairs were Robert A. Barrett (Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne) and John T. Gorgone (Bentley College).  There was a 69.3% acceptance rate with 75 papers submitted and 52 accepted. There were 429 pre-registered participants.</p>
<p>The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education award was given to Alan Perlis (Yale University) for contributions to education, especially through his work on programming languages and compiler construction. Pretty cool that the inaugural Turing Award winner was the 2nd SIGCSE award winner! Wish I could have heard that keynote!</p>

<h3><a name="1981" id="1981">1981</a></h3>
<p>1981 brought several now-familiar elements to our organization. It was the first year the Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education award was given out, and it went to William Atchison, the Head of ACM Curriculum Committee that produced Curriculum '68, and a founding leader of University of Maryland Computer Science Department. Here’s the announcement from the Bulletin:</p>
<p><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/Bulletin1981.jpg" alt="The Bulletin 1981" /></p>
<p>In 1981 we elected a new Board:  Norman Gibbs (who moved to Arizona State University) as Chair, Della Bonnette (University of Southwestern Louisiana) as Vice-Chair, John Frederick Schrage (Southern Illinois University – Edwardsville) for Secretary. At-Large members elected were Robert Aiken (University of Tennessee), Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin) and Joyce Currie Little (Community College of Baltimore).</p>
<p>The 12th Technical Symposium was held February 26-27, 1981 in St. Louis, MO. The Conference Chair was Kenneth Magel (University of Missouri at Rolla). The Program Chairs were Frank G. Walters (University of Missouri at Rolla) and Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin).  There were 62 papers submitted with 46 accepted giving a 71.2% acceptance rate.</p>
<p>There were many changes made to the Technical Symposium based on feedback from the previous ones. This Technical Symposium introduced some of our now well-known conference features:  tutorials, workshops, Birds of a Feather, and Panel Sessions. These were all explicitly stated in the call for scholarship.</p>

<h3><a name="1980" id="1980">1980</a></h3>
<p>On February 14-15, 1980 the 11th Technical Symposium was held in Kansas City, MO. Bill Bulgren (University of Kansas) served as Conference Chair.  Virgil Wallentine (Kansas City University) was the Program Chair.<br />
The Bulletin (Vol. 12, Issue 2, July 1980) reported on the Business Meeting held during the conference:</p>
<p><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinJuly1980.jpg" alt="The Bulletin Vol. 12, Issue 2, July 1980" /></p>
<p>The same issue of The Bulletin contains a survey asking questions about plagiarism in computing classes. Students haven’t changed that much…</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a name="1979" id="1979">1979</a></h3>
<p>The 10th Technical Symposium was held Feb 22-23 in Dayton, OH.  Doug Kerr (Ohio State) served as the Conference Chair.  John Dalphin (Indiana University – Purdue At Fort Wayne) was the Program Chair and 54 papers were accepted.</p>
<p>We also elected a new Board. Robert Aiken (University of Tennessee) was re-elected as Chair and Norman Gibbs (College of William and Mary) was re-elected as Vice-Chair. James Powell (Burroughs Wellcome Company) was elected as Secretary-Treasurer.  All three Director members were re-elected:  Richard Austing (University of Maryland), Gerald Engel (Christopher Newport College), and Betty Sproule (Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp).  Della Bonnette (University of Southwestern Louisiana) continued as Bulletin Editor (the last of 4 terms) and John Gorgone (Bentley College) continued as the Assistant Bulletin Editor.</p>
<p>The Bulletin (Volume 11, Issue 3, September 1979) announced the creation of the SIGCSE Annual Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education, and that the recipient would give a keynote at the Technical Symposium. It took 2 years from announcement to the first award.</p>
<p>Here’s a good one: at the October 31, 1979 Business meeting, the idea of corporate sponsors was initiated. The proposal was for sponsors to pay $200 and receive SIGCSE publications, free attendance at the Technical Symposium, and have their company listed on the inside cover of the Bulletin.</p>

<h3><a name="1978" id="1978">1978</a></h3>
<p>This year was the 10th Anniversary of the founding of SIGCSE. During 1978 we held two conferences, but only one was designated as the Technical Symposium.</p>
<p>As reported in The Bulletin (Vol. 9, Issue 4, Dec. 1977):</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken Williams is organizing what appears to be one of our most successful SIGCSE Symposia (scheduled for February 23-24 in Detroit). He reports that he has already received a number of interesting papers and they're still rolling in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Volume 10, Issue 1, February 1978 contains the papers of the SIGCSE/CSA technical symposium on computer science education – but is NOT an official numbered Technical Symposium.  This conference was held in Detroit, Michigan and chaired by Ken Williams (Western Michigan University) and had 53 papers accepted with 352 people in attendance. A full report can be found at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382187"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382187</a>.</p>
<p>The official 9th Technical Symposium was held August 14-15 in Pittsburgh and was joint with IEEE/Computer Society Education Committee. Alf Bertztiss (University of Pittsburgh) was the General Chair.</p>
<p>From The Bulletin (Vol. 10, Issue 2, June 1978):<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/ninthTS.jpg" alt="The Bulletin Vol. 10, Issue 2, June 1978" /><br />
Volume 10, Issue 3, August 1978 contains the papers from this conference. There were over 100 attendees and they came from 25 different states, Canada, Mexico, and Iceland.</p>
<p>You may find it interesting to know the types of events, around the world, that SIGCSE members were involved in, way back in the late 70s. In Volume 10, Issue 4, December 1978 of The Bulletin, the following events were brought to members attention:</p>
<ul><li>ACM ’78, December where a business meeting was held and SIGCSE sponsored several sessions
</li><li>CSC/SIGCSE, the 10th Technical Symposium in February, 1979
</li><li>National Education Computing Conference (NECC), June 1979 in Iowa City, billed as a cross-fertilization effort with other organizations such as AEDS, ADCIS, and IEEE Computer Society.
</li><li>International Symposium on Computers and Education in Dusseldorf, Germany, March, 1979
</li><li>Third World Conference on Computer Education, Lausanne, Switzerland, July 1981
</li></ul><p>Even then we were global! At the December 1978 Business Meeting, there was a discussion on whether we should be named CSE or CE (computing education). The name issue is 40 years old!<br />

<h3><a name="1977" id="1977">1977</a></h3>
<p>The 7th Technical Symposium was held February 2-3, 1977 at the Marriott Hotel in Atlanta, GA jointly with CSC. John Goda from Georgia Institute of Technology was the Conference Chair.  See <a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/810000/800008/fm/frontmatter.pdf?ip=137.48.185.10"> https://portalparts.acm.org/810000/800008/fm/frontmatter.pdf?ip=137.48.185.10 </a><br />
for the proceedings. This appears to be the first occurrence of a workshop (then called Birds of a Feather) on Structured COBOL by Daniel McCracken, and the first occurrence of a student programming contest at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>SIGCSE held another Technical Symposium, the 8th on August 4-5, 1977 at the University of Southwestern Louisiana Conference Center in Lafayette, LA. Della Bonnette (from University of Southwestern Louisiana) was the Conference Chair and Terry Walker, also from University of Southwestern Louisiana, was the Program Chair. Eighteen papers were accepted for presentation.</p>
<p>New officers were elected to lead the organization. Robert Aiken served as Chair with Norman Gibbs as Vice-Chair. Terry Walker was the Secretary/Treasurer. Board Members were Richard Austing (past chair), Gerald Engel (past vice-chair), and Betty Sproule (first female board member!). Della Bonnette continued in her 3rd term as Bulletin Editor and John Gorgone assisted.</p>
<p>It appears that Betty Sproule has found a successful second career after CS:   <a href="http://stuffcure.com"> http://stuffcure.com </a></p>
<p>There were three special issues of the Bulletin this year: the February issue contained the proceedings of the 7th Technical Symposium; the June issue was on computer science curricula; and the July issue contained the proceedings of the 8th Technical Symposium.  From the June issue:<br /><br /><br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinJune1977.jpg" alt="June 1977 issue of the Bulletin" /><br /></p>

<h3><a name="1976" id="1976">1976</a></h3>
<p>From 1976 through 1978, there were actually TWO Technical Symposiums held each year. The first was held in February, jointly with CSC. The second, held late mid-year was only a SIGCSE event.</p>
<p>In 1976, the 5th Technical Symposium was held February 12-13 at Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, CA as part of the ACM Computer Science Conference. Paul Lorton, Jr. of the University of San Francisco and Ron Colman from California State University at Fullerton were Conference Chairs.  We don’t know how many papers were submitted, but 66 were accepted. In the Digital Library, this is listed as the “Proceedings of the SIGCSE-SIGCUE joint symposium on Computer Science Education” (SIGCUE being Computer Uses in Education), but I can find no corroboration that this was joint.</p>
<p>Bob Aiken adds this explanation:<br /></p><blockquote>I remember our Symposia being at least two days with their own General Chair and Program Chair (and committee). Some registration numbers were difficult to unearth and cost sharing sometimes hard to negotiate (though each leadership group tried hard to be equitable). I do remember that during that period we set a goal of 1,000 attendees for the SIGCSE Symposium … and it took us a number of years to finally reach it (though we were only slightly under that goal for several years before achieving it)! </blockquote>
<p>In July of 1976, SIGCSE held its 6th Technical Symposium at Fort Magruder in Williamsburg, VA – on our own! Norman Gibbs from the College of William and Mary was the Conference Chair. Thirty-five papers were accepted for presentation.<br />

<h3><a name="1975" id="1975">1975</a></h3>
<p>The 5th Technical Symposium was held February 20-21, 1975 in Washington, D.C.  The Conference Chair was Gerald Engel from Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Program chairs were Bruce Barnes (NSF), Norm Gibbs (College of William and Mary), Susan Gerhart (Duke University), Andrew Molnar (NSF), Glenn Ingram (NIE), Joyce Little (Community College of Baltimore), C.K. Capstick (University of Guelph), Harris Burns (Randolph-Macon College), Richard Austing (University of Maryland), and Larry John (University of Dayton). There were just over 300 attendees. Sadly, there seems to be no record of this event in the Digital Library.</p>
<p>In 1975 a new slate of officers was elected. Richard Austing was re-elected to the Chair Position. Douglas Kerr was the Vice-Chair, and John Dalphin served as Secretary/Treasurer. Board Members included Barry Bateman for a second term, Robert Aiken, and Elliott Organick. Della Bonnette continued as the Bulletin Editor and continued to be assisted by John Dalphin.<br />

<h3><a name="1974" id="1974">1974</a></h3>
<p>In 1974 the 4th Technical Symposium was held in Detroit, MI on February 14-15. Douglas Kerr from The Ohio State University was Conference Chair. Program Chairs were Toby Berk (Florida International University), Harris Burns (Randolph-Macon College), Clinton Foulk (Ohio State), Larry John (University of Dayton), Bruce Klein (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University), and Wayne Tam (Wayne State University). We don’t know how many papers were submitted, but 38 were accepted and there were approximately 250 attendees. The proceedings from this year within the Digital Library only seem to include the CSC presentations and no forward matter exists.</p>
<p>The 4th Technical Symposium was also Frank Friedman’s first SIGCSE conference that he attended, and then he attended for 30 straight years, minus 1. That’s dedication!<br />

<h3><a name="1973" id="1973">1973</a></h3>
<p>Starting in 1973 our Technical Symposia were held in conjunction with the “Computer Science Conference.” This conference focused more on research and primarily consisted of a few invited speakers and numerous short abstracts of ongoing Computer Science research activities. Providing a forum for PhD candidates to discuss their work and for departments to recruit was also a primary function!  Originally it was sponsored by some large Universities and corporations.  ACM handled many of the organizing details. </p>
<p>The 3rd Technical Symposium was held February 22-23, 1973 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH, in conjunction with the Computer Science Conference (CSC). Gerald Engel from Pennsylvania State University was the Conference Chair. “Over 80” papers were submitted with 43 of them accepted for presentation. Check out <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1125118"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1125118</a> for a look at the programs. Here’s the conference committee:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/thirdTS.png" alt="The 1973 conference committee" /></p>
<p>However, since the Technical Symposium was held jointly with CSC, exact attendance numbers are difficult to ascertain. It was the primarily those associated with the CSC that handled most of the finances, registration, etc. (though we had a reasonably straightforward agreement as to how our registration would be handled, finances and expenses determined--mostly from exhibits and registrations). This resulted in SIGCSE not having total control over the exact “numbers.” For example, one day and late registrations were sometime difficult to ascertain. However, we do have a few estimates. For our meeting in Columbus in 1973 we had about 200 attendees.</p>
<p>We have two pictures from this conference:<br /><img src="../files/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/TaulbeeYovits.jpg" alt="Marshall Yovits receiving thank you gift from Orrin Taulbee." /><br />
Orrin E. Taulbee, University of Pittsburgh and Marshall Yovits, Ohio State CS Chair, 1973<br />
Taulbee did the Taulbee Report.  Yovits probably chaired the very first CSC.</p>

1973? Computer Science Conference Committee (Thanks to Frank Friedman for the picture).</p>
<p>Some were ACM officers, including Gwen Bell.  According to Frank: “Most of the CSC Committee were women and they were REALLY GOOD people.  They basically ran the show.”</p>
<p>A new Board was also elected. Chair was Richard Austing. Vice-Chair was Gerald Engel. Secretary/Treasurer was J. Robert Jump. Board Members were Barry Bateman, Aaron Finerman (past chair), and Seymour Pollock (past Symposium chair). Della Bonnette became the Bulletin Editor and was assisted by John Dalphin. A quick internet search says that Della Bonnette is still active with CSAB and accreditation issues.</p>
<p>My sincere gratitude to Bob Aiken for helping me dig up some of this information.<br />

<h3><a name="1972" id="1972">1972</a></h3>
<p>The 2nd Technical Symposium was held at Washington University in St. Louis on March 24-25, 1972. The Conference Chair was Seymour V. Pollack from Washington University in St. Louis. The Program Chair was Leland Williams from Triangle Universities Computation Center and Robert Aiken (University of Tennessee) once again was Editor of the Proceedings. Again, “over 40” papers were submitted with approximately 30 being accepted.  There were 179 attendees. (Briana Morrison)</p>
<p>Also, some additional information from Chris Wilcox about the man who organized SIGCSE and was the first Chair:<br />
Dr. Organick was my master's thesis advisor and a personal friend of our family. I first met him by chance in the 1970's at a remote lake in the Uinta mountains where my father and I were backpacking. He was diagnosed with leukemia shortly afterward, and told that he had a very short time to live, however he actually survived for another ten years. During that period he became my advisor and I learned from him as well as teaching for him numerous times during his illness. I credit him with sending me down the path of becoming a computer science professor. He was a man of complete integrity and boundless energy, both before and after his diagnosis. I still remember him telling me with his usual prescience how excited he was about object-oriented programming (in Ada), and how that would be the next big thing, I think anyone that knew him would give the same sort of testimonial, and I was not in the least surprised that he was a charter member of the SIGCSE organization.  (Chris Wilcox)</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a name="1971" id="1971">1971</a></h3>
<p>There was no Technical Symposium held during 1971, instead it was moved to the early months of the following year (February/March) which has been fairly constant since that time. SIGCSE did get a new slate of officers in 1971: Aaron Finerman was Chair, Tom Kurtz was Vice-Chair, and David Matula continued as Secretary/Treasurer.  Board members included Robert Aiken, Peter Denning, and Richard Hamming. Robert Aiken continued to serve as the Bulletin Editor. (Briana Morrison)</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a name="1970" id="1970">1970</a></h3>
<p>In 1970 SIGCSE Board Members were Elliott Organick, Chair; David Matula, Secretary/Treasurer; and Robert Aiken was the Bulletin Editor.</p>
<p>The SIGCSE Technical Symposium was the first conference organized by our newly founded SIG. The first Technical Symposium was held on the 16th of November, 1970 in Houston, TX. Peter Calingaert from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was the Conference Chair. Edward A. Feustel from Rice University was in charge of Arrangements and Publicity and Robert Aiken from the University of Tennessee was the Program Chair and Editor of the Proceedings. There were 143 attendees. There were “over 40” papers submitted with 18 accepted. :</p>
<p>The program was divided into three main sections:<br />
1) morning session looked at computer science in a global sense<br />
2) afternoon session looked at courses generally, and<br />
3) the evening session considered the first course in computer science</p>
<p>In addition, the question of establishing a Journal of Computer Science Education was brought up and the consensus of the group was that the SIGCSE Bulletin was meeting the current need.</p>
<p>The December 1970 issue of the Bulletin (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873668"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873668</a>) lists the 600+ members of the organization! It also contained the announcement of the first student paper competition.<br />

<h3><a name="1969" id="1969">1969</a></h3>
<p>Beginning in 1969 Elliot Organick served as the founding chair of SIGCSE with Bob Aiken the founding secretary/treasurer and TW Hildebrandt the founding editor of the Bulletin. The first Steering Group (the original Board) consisted of Jack Belzer, Peter Calingaert, TW Hildebradt, Thomas Keenan, Earl Schweppe, and William Viavant. William Atchison and S.D. Conte served as Ex-Officio members of the Steering Group. (Briana Morrison)</p>
<p>The FIRST SIGCSE Bulletin was published in February, 1969 (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873609"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873609</a>) and was 22 typed pages! It included information about the organizing committee of the newly formed SIG and a call for a move toward a journal on computer science education (what foresight!). There is also a wonderful article on a survey sent to the SIGCSE members on their ranking of problem/discussion areas.</p>
<p>The second Bulletin was published in June, 1969 (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873611"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873611</a>) followed by additional editions in October (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873615"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873615</a>) and December (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873618"> https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873618</a>). The October issued noted that there were more than 350 members. We have had 4 or 5 issues of the Bulletin every year since.</p>

<h3><a name="1968" id="1968">1968</a></h3>
<p>The year is 1968. A group of computing educators met at the Fall Joint Computer Conference (FJCC) in Las Vegas to write and sign a petition that eventually led to the creation of SIGCSE. Elliot Irving Organick (1925 – 1985) is credited with being the driving force behind the group. The petition was signed by 20 ACM members, including Bob Aiken.
