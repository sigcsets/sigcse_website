The following listing suggests several ways that SIGCSE members can participate in various activities of the organization.</p>
<p>Some more information about volunteering for SIGCSE can be found in this <a href="../files/documents/pdfs/How%20to%20Volunteer%20with%20SIGCSE%202019.pdf">presentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Attending conferences:</strong>  SIGCSE sponsors four computing education conferences, three held annually and one biennially:</p>
<ul><li>The annual SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education is held in February or March in the United States.
</li>
<li>
The annual Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education conference (ITiCSE) is usually held in June or July in Europe.
</li>
<li>
The annual International Computing Education Research (ICER) Conference aims at gathering high-quality contributions to the computing education research discipline. It is held at sites in North America, Europe, and Australasia.
</li>
<li>
The biennial ACM Global Computing Education Conference will be held for the first time in 2019. This will be held in sites other than North America, Europe, and Australasia.
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Reviewing papers and other submissions for conferences:</strong>  Papers, panels, and other submissions to SIGCSE conferences undergo an extensive reviewing process.</p>
<ul><li>
SIGCSE members are usually invited to volunteer to review for the Technical Symposium each year through an on-line form before reviewing commences.  The home pages of the conferences have more details.
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Participating on and/or starting a SIGCSE Committee:</strong> SIGCSE's Committee Initiative encourages all SIGCSE members to participate in substantive discussions on areas of community interest, with the goals of investigating topics in depth and culminating with substantive reports.<br />
For more information, see <a href="../programs/committees.html">SIGCSE Committees</a></p>
<p><strong>Creating/Joining a local SIGCSE Chapter:</strong> Local or regional associations provide a mechanism for collaboration and cooperation within your locale. A SIGCSE Chapter can provide a structure to facilitate this exchange. For more information, see <a href="../programs/local-chapters.html">SIGCSE Local Chapters</a></p>
<p><strong>Submitting a Special Project Grant Proposal:</strong> SIGCSE now funds a limited number of Special Projects to help its members investigate and introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of computing. The maximum funding is $5,000 USD per proposal and the level of funding is subject to the quality of proposals received and the availability of funds targeted for such projects. For previous award winners and instructions for how to apply, see <a href="../programs/special.html">SIGCSE Special Projects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Working on a Symposium or Conference Committee:</strong> SIGCSE conferences happen because volunteers handle numerous responsibilities and details.</p>
<ul><li>
Some common tasks:  conference co-chair, program co-chair, panels, special sessions, workshops, posters, birds-of-a-feather, proceedings, treasurer, registration, local arrangements, student volunteers/activities, evaluation, roommate matching, database administration, tips and techniques, demonstrations, etc.
</li>
<li>
Your SIGCSE Board selects experienced leaders as conference and program co-chairs.  All other positions are selected by those co-chairs on the basis of known willingness to serve.  Typically, committee membership includes a mix of experienced and new people.
</li>
