Working Groups are a special feature of ITiCSE and have been part of the conference since its beginning in 1996.  In 2019 Working Groups will also convene at the inaugural CompEd conference.</p>
<p>Working Groups provide a wonderful opportunity to work intensively on a topic of interest with an international group of computing education researchers. Working groups begin work electronically for several months before convening for face-to-face work at the conference. At the end of the face-to-face meeting the groups submit a draft report that is refined over the following few weeks. The reports are reviewed and, if accepted, published in the ACM digital library. </p>
<p>Signing up to a Working Group is a commitment to hard work â€¦ but rewarding and unforgettable experiences. Working Group reports are some of the most cited computing education publications in the ACM Digital Library.</p>
