The SIGCSE Speaker's Fund supports the dissemination of outstanding SIGCSE Technical Symposium, ITiCSE, ICER, or CompEd presentations to other venues. The program is open to any non-ACM conference holding "In-Cooperation" status with SIGCSE. Conference organizers may apply for funds to bring one or more speakers from recent Symposium/ITiCSE/ICER gatherings to the meeting to repeat their presentations. The nominated speaker must not be a SIGCSE Board member. </p>
<p>Although we expect most proposals will be for paper presentations, we will also consider support for other types of presentations, such as panels or workshops. Expansion of previous presentations, for example from a 30 minute presentation to a 60 minute presentation, is also appropriate. </p>
<p>The <a href="outreach/awards.html">List of Previous Speaker's Fund Awards</a> shows the diversity of presentations that have been made available to a wider audience through this program. </p>
<p>Funding is limited to $1000 per conference, per year. Funds are for travel support only (transportation, accommodation, meals), not for registrations or honorariums. The level of funding is subject to the quality of proposals received and the availability of funds. </p>
<p>To learn more about In-Cooperation status, see <a href="../programs/cooperation.html">SIGCSE's In-Cooperation Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Application Guidelines</strong><br />
The application process is relatively informal. Applications must indicate:</p>
<ul><li>the name and dates of the In-Cooperation conference </li>
<li>the name of the presenter </li>
<li>what will be presented and when it was originally presented at SIGCSE/ITiCSE/ICER </li>
<li>a requested amount with a description of how the funds will be used </li>
<li>a brief statement of reasons why the presentation was selected </li>
</ul><p>Submit the application at least four months prior to the conference via e-mail to the Speaker's Fund Review Committee at <a href="mailto:apply@sigcse.org">apply@sigcse.org</a>. Be sure to include all the information requested above.</p>
<p>If a Speaker's Fund proposal is funded, the In-Cooperation conference accepts the following obligations:</p>
<ul><li>Make a short announcement at a plenary session of the meeting; for example, "We would like to thank the ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education for providing support for Jane Doe to present her paper, Educational Challenges for the New Millenium, tomorrow afternoon. This paper was originally presented at ITiCSE 2003." </li>
<li>Include a similar statement in the conference program. </li>
<li>Make a link to the SIGCSE membership page (<a href="../../membership.html">http://sigcse.org/membership</a>) available either on the conference web page, in the conference program, or both.</li>
<li>After the event, prepare a short report describing how the presentation went. This report will be sent to the Speakers Fund Project Review Committee at <a href="mailto:apply@sigcse.org">apply@sigcse.org</a>. </li>
<li>Contact the <a href="mailto:treasurer@sigcse.org"> SIGCSE treasurer</a> for instructions on how to submit the receipts for covered expenses for reimbursement. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Process for Making Awards</strong><br />
The SIGCSE Board will appoint a Speaker's Fund Project Review Committee to judge the proposals and make the funding decisions. In considering amounts awarded to individual conferences, the Review Committee may take into account the overall budget for the event. All unsuccessful applicants will received feedback on their application from the Review Committee. The Review Committee will consider all applications as confidential.</p>
