SIGCSE seeks proposals from universities interested in hosting the ACM Global Computing Education Conference. The conference takes place any time during the year, but at least 6 weeks away from one of SIGCSEâ€™s other conference.</p>
<p>An initial proposal to host ACM Global Computing Education Conference must address the following:</p>
<ul><li>Availability of a lecture hall for the plenary sessions seating 140 or more people.
</li><li>Availability of at least three lecture halls for parallel sessions each seating 60 or more people.
</li><li>Availability of a poster session/coffee break space.
</li><li>Excursion opportunities.
</li><li>Availability and cost of accommodations (on and/or off campus).
</li><li>Availability and cost of food and beverage options.
</li><li>Transportation issues for off campus housing.
</li><li>Administrative or facility costs.
</li></ul><p>Note that all lecture halls must have computer projection and internet connectivity. After the initial proposal, follow-up conversations will cover various additional details.</p>
