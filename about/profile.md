#### Mission Statement

ACM SIGCSE is the leading global community of professionals, researchers, educators, teachers, and students interested in understanding and improving computing education. We provide opportunities and resources to advance educational research and practice related to designing, developing, and implementing pedagogy, curricula, programs, and tools at all levels in all types of educational settings. SIGCSE values diverse perspectives. We welcome and work to include the participation of all societies, people, and demographics in computing education.
