July 2005 - June 2006\
Submitted by: Henry M. Walker, SIGCSE Chair

Following its mission statement, SIGCSE \"provides a forum for problems
common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate
computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi,
laboratories, and other elements of teaching a pedagogy.\" In addition
to its own activities, SIGCSE continues to work with SIGITE, ACM\'s
Special Interest Group for Information Technology Education, and CSTA,
the Computer Science Teachers\' Association that focuses on K-12
education. In the spirit of this collaboration, SIGCSE invited Robb
Cutler, CSTA Chair, and Chris Stephenson, CSTA Executive Director, to
give a keynote address on \"Working Together to Improve K-12 Computer
Science Education\" at the SIGCSE 2006 Symposium.

**Conferences** SIGCSE sponsors three annual conferences:

-   This year, SIGCSE started a new conference, [ICER
    2005](http://icer2005.cs.washington.edu/), for International
    Computing Education Research. Nearly 60 participants attended ICER
    2005, held 1-2 October at the University of Washington under the
    insightful leadership of Sally Fincher, Richard Anderson, and Mark
    Guzdial. A lovely report also appeared in the November 2005 issue of
    the Computing Research News,
    <http://www.cra.org/CRN/articles/nov05/guzdial.html>
-   The 2006 SIGCSE Technical Symposium (SIGCSE 2006) was held on 1-5
    March 2006, in Houston, TX USA. Conference registration was very
    healthy at 1165, and 502 people signed up for workshops. This year,
    294 papers, 26 panels, 18 special sessions, and 50 workshops were
    submitted, and these were reviewed by 608 reviewers. All papers
    received at least 4 reviews, and most received 5 or 6. The final
    program accepted 104 papers, for an acceptance rate of 35.4%.
    Regarding external contributions, SIGCSE was delighted to involve 29
    exhibitors to SIGCSE 2006. Much credit is due Symposium Co-chairs,
    Doug Baldwin from SUNY Geneseo and Paul Tymann from Rochester
    Institute of Technology.
-   The 2006 Innovations and Technology in Computer Science Education
    Conference (ITiCSE 2006) was held 26-28 June 2006, at the University
    of Bologna in Italy. This conference set a record at over 200
    attendees. Submissions included 194 papers, 4 panels, 18
    software/courseware announcements, 51 posters, 6 student posters, 12
    tutorials, 17 tips and techniques, and 13 working groups. All papers
    were reviewed by at least 3 reviewers each (most by 5 or 6), 378
    reviewers were involved in the reviewing process, and 60 papers were
    accepted (30.9%). Many thanks to Conference and Program Co-Chairs,
    Renzo Davoli and Paola Salomoni from the University of Bologna and
    Michael Goldweber from Xavier University.

    SIGCSE\'s 2006 Award for Lifetime Service.

**Special Project Grants** SIGCSE continues to invite its members to
apply for [Special Project
Grants]({{"/program/special/index.html" | absolute_url}}) to investigate and
introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of computing. The
maximum funding is \$5,000 USD per proposal and the level of funding is
subject to the quality of proposals received and the availability of
funds targeted for such projects.

The following table shows the activity for this program since its
inception in 2003:

**Committee Initiative**\
SIGCSE encourages its members to discuss topics of significance to the
computing-education community through its [Committee
Initiative]({{"/programs/committees/index.html" | absolute_url}}). The following outlines
SIGCSE\'s four current committees:

1\) SIGCSE Committee on the Implementation of a One-Semester Course in
Discrete Mathematics

-   Facilitators: William Marion from Valpariso State University and
    Douglas Baldwin from the State University of New York at Geneseo.
-   Status: After circulating draft materials and presenting interim
    reports at conferences, a final report is in preparation.

2\) SIGCSE Committee on Expanding the Women-in-Computing Community

-   Facilitators: Gloria Childress Townsend, DePauw University and Paula
    Gabbert, Furman University.
-   Status: This committee engages interested individuals, particularly
    at conferences. Projects include identifying \"recruiting and
    retaining women (R&R) in computing\" and highlighting success
    stories regarding R&R, and fostering communication with interested
    computing educators related to expanding the community of women in
    computing.

3\) SIGCSE Committee on the Teaching of Computer Science Research
Methods

-   Facilitators: Anne Applin, Ithaca College and Hillary Holz from
    California State University, East Bay.
-   Status: After a year of preparation, several committee members met
    as a Working Group at ITiCSE 2006. A draft report is in progress.

4\) SIGCSE Committee on Models for Evaluating Faculty Scholarship

-   Facilitators: Gerald Kruse, Juniata College, Shmuel Fink, Touro
    College, and Keith Olson, Utah Valley State College
-   Status: Organized this past year, the Committee held a
    Birds-of-a-Feather session at SIGCSE 2006, and it is beginning to
    consider the collection and organization of data.

Discussions continue with several individuals and groups regarding
possible new SIGCSE Committees. When dialog yields a subject of general
community interest, a clear focus, and 2-4 facilitators, a proposal can
go forward to the SIGCSE Board for the creation of a new SIGCSE
Committee. More information may be found about the [SIGCSE Committee
Initiative]({{"/programs/committees/index.html" | absolute_url}}).

**Bulletin, *inroads***\
SIGCSE publishes inroads the SIGCSE Bulletin, quarterly.

-   The March issue is the Proceedings of SIGCSE\'s annual Symposium
-   The September issue is the Proceedings of SIGCSE\'s annual
    Conference on Innovation and Integrating Technology in Computer
    Science Education
-   The June and December issues contain columns, editorials, and
    articles on computing education.
-   The December issue also contains a CD of the Proceedings of the
    SIGCSE Workshop on International Computing Education Research.

John Impagliazzo provides outstanding leadership, vision, and insight in
his role as Editor-in-Chief.

**In-Cooperation Conferences**\
As with other ACM Special Interest Groups, SIGCSE may lend its name to
non-SIGCSE events that are fully sponsored by other non-profit
organizations. To be approved, the event(s) must be relevant to SIGCSE
and provide some sort of benefit to SIGCSE members. SIGCSE will not
share in the direct financial support, benefit, or risk of the event.
\"In-Cooperation\" status allows the conference to be publicized on
ACM\'s on-line calendar, and conference proceedings may be indexed
through the ACM Digital Library. Additional information is available
regarding [\"in-cooperation\"
status]({{"/policies/incooperation.html" | absolute_url}}), and inquiries
may be sent to <chair@sigcse.org>.

For a full list of SIGCSE-sponsored and \"in-cooperation\" events, see
the \"ACM Calendar of SIGCSE Events\"available from the home page.

**Doctoral Consortium**\
SIGCSE\'s Doctoral Consortium provides a forum for graduate students to
refine directions for their research, receive feedback on their research
ideas, and develop a network of contacts for on-going discussions. The
Doctoral Consortium is held annually on the on the Wednesday before the
SIGCSE Symposium in February or March. This year, fourteen people
participated in this program.

**Outreach Project**\
SIGCSE\'s [Outreach Project]({{"/programs/speakers/index.html" | absolute_url}}) supports
the dissemination of outstanding SIGCSE/ITiCSE presentations to other
venues. The program is open to any non-ACM conference holding
\"In-Cooperation\" status with SIGCSE. Funds are for travel support only
(transportation, accommodation, meals), not for registrations or
honoraria. The level of funding is subject to the quality of proposals
received and the availability of funds. During the 2005-2006 academic
year SIGCSE was pleased to fund seven proposals.

**Workshop for Department Chairs**\
This past year, with the encouragement of the SIGCSE Board, Frank Young
of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Sue Fitzgerald from Metropolitan
State University, and Sandra DeLoatch from Norfolk State University
organized an extremely well-received Workshop for Department Chairs,
held just before the SIGCSE 2006 Symposium. This first workshop,
attended by 20 participants, focused on organizational matters,
planning, and the addressing of common problems \-- with a particular
focus on issues for new chairs. Building on the success of this first
session, the next Workshop for Department Chairs is being planned in
conjunction with SIGCSE 2007, expanding the focus to include all
department chairs in computer science.

**Web Site/Internet Presence**\
SIGCSE is fortunate to have three capable volunteers who oversee its
electronic presence:

-   Scott Grissom from Grand Valley State University serves as Web
    master.
-   Jesse Heines from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and
-   Frank Young from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology serve as
    listserv moderators.

Many thanks to each of these people for the wonderful work that they do.

**Doctoral Programs in Computer Science Education**\
In response to requests for information, the SIGCSE Board asked Sue
Fitzgerald from Metropolitan State University and Lisa Kaczmarczyk from
Rose Hulman Institute of Technology to help start a project to identify
CS Ed doctoral programs and to identify resources for those interested
in that area. Initial materials are being gathered and organized. Many
thanks to Sue and Lisa for their on-going efforts on this project.
Thanks also to Ann Fluery who contributed at the start of this work.

**On-line Education Links**\
[SIGCSE Education Links]({{"/resources/index.html" | absolute_url}}) is a collection of
resources maintained and shared by SIGCSE members to support computer
science education. All members of the educational community can borrow
resources and learn from others. SIGCSE members are encouraged to share
their resources.
