This report concludes my first year as SIGCSE Chair. I want to thank all
of the members of the 2010-2013 SIGCSE Board: Daniel Joyce, Vice-Chair,
Doug Baldwin, Treasurer, Susan Rodger, Secretary, Barbara Owens,
Immediate past-chair, Tiffany Barnes, Mark Guzdial and Amber Settle, our
publication editors: John Impagliazzo, Z Sweedyk, and Henry Walker, and
my ACM contacts, especially Ginger Ignatoff, for their support this past
year.

Awards:\
Each year, SIGCSE gives two awards for outstanding contributions to the
computer science education community. The SIGCSE Award for Lifetime
Service to the Computer Science Education Community was presented to
Gordon Davies, Department of Computing, Open University (retired). The
SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education
was presented to Matthias Felleisen, Trustee Professor at College of
Computer Science, Northeastern University. Both awards were presented
during the 2011 Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education.

In 2011, two of our conferences gave their first ever \"best paper\"
awards.

The SIGCSE 2011 best paper award went to Kathi Fisler, Guillaume Marceau
and Shriram Krishnamurthi for their paper entitled \"Measuring the
Effectiveness of Error Messages Designed for Novice Programmers.\"

ITICSE 2011 best paper award went to Randy Connolly for his paper
\"Beyond Good and Evil Impacts: Rethinking the Social Issues Components
in Our Computing Curricula.\"

Conferences:\
SIGCSE sponsored three conferences: the Technical Symposium , the ITiCSE
conference and the research conference known as the ICER workshop.

The International Computing Education Research Workshop (ICER 2010) was
held in Aarhus, Denmark at Aarhus University, August 9 & 10, and was
chaired by Michael Caspersen. A Doctoral Consorsortium for Ph.D.
students pursuing computer science education research was held on August
8. The workshop included 12 papers and one keynote address. It also
included two workshops: a pre-conference workshop on assessment and a
post-conference workshop on how a socio-cultural framework can enrich
(research in) computer science education. The number of attendees was
38.

The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE 2011) was
held at the Sheraton Dallas Hotel in Dallas, Texas, March 9-12, and was
chaired by Ellen Walker and Thomas Cortina. The confererence drew a
record crowd and included 3 keynote presenations, 107 papers, 22 panel
or special sessions, 35 workshops, 48 posters, 36 birds-of-a-feather
sessions, 7 videos, a student research competition, and a robot hoedown.
The number of attendees was 1187.

The Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education conference
(ITiCSE 2011) was held in Darmstadt, Germany at Technische Universität
Darmstadt, and was chaired by Guido Rößling. The program included 3
working groups, two keynote presentations, and 65 papers, 52 posters and
16 tips, techniques, or courseware presentations. The number of
attendees was 199.

In addition, SIGCSE cooperates with many groups and grants
in-cooperation status to several conferences, giving us an even larger
impact across the world.

Other accomplishments:

-   The SIGCSE by-laws were changed to officially re-establish the
    immediate past-chair as a member of the Executive Board.
-   Membership benefits were changed to provide members with a single CD
    each year that contains all conference proceedings, the SIGCSE
    Bulletin, and the ITiCSE conference working group reports.
-   SIGCSE completed the 2011 fiscal year with a healthy surplus.

SIGCSE is active in many areas and innovative programs, including:

-   endorsement of the Computing Principles project, which involves
    development of a new course to broaden participation in computing
    and computer science.
-   partnership with other disciplinary societies in Project
    Kaleidoscope\'s (PKAL) Mobilizing STEM Education for a Sustainable
    Future.
-   participation in curriculum revision efforts in the areas of
    Software Engineering and Computer Engineering
-   support of various special projects, including the \"Taulbee for the
    Rest of US\" (TauRUS) project to survey U.S. institutions offering
    undergraduate degrees in Computer Science to collect information on
    degrees, students and faculty
-   funding of speakers from SIGCSE conferences to present at at several
    in-cooperation conferences through our speakers fund

Key issues that the membership of that SIG will have to deal with in the
next 2-3 years:

-   An important issue will be dealing with increased international
    expansion of ACM. SIGCSE already has an international presence with
    a significant international membership. We sponsor an annual
    conference held outside the U.S. (ITiCSE) and another workshop that
    rotates through being held in the U.S. Europe and Australasia. What
    we currently do not have is any international representation on the
    SIGCSE Board. We have an Australasian \"chapter\" (which seems like
    an odd name for such a large number of members and geographic
    space), and are discussing European, Indian, Chinese and South
    American expansion (more \"chapters\"?). Managing this growth and
    providing an equitable voice for these regions will be a key issue
    for SIGCSE.
-   SIGCSE will continue to participate in ongoing ACM education
    projects such as curriculum revisions
-   We will continue to collaborate with CSTA on K-12 issues.
