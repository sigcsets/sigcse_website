### 2017<a name="#2017"></a>

We are up to 2017 and the 48th Technical Symposium was held March 8-11
in Seattle, Washington. The Conference Chairs were Michael E. Caspersen
(Aarhus University) and Stephen Edwards (Virginia Tech). The Program
Chairs were Tiffany Barnes (North Carolina State University) and Dan
Garcia (University of California Berkeley). The SIGCSE 2017 conference
theme---Inspire, Innovate, Improve!---highlights our aim to inspire
computing educators to innovate new teaching strategies, and to improve
those strategies by engaging in the self-reflection and evaluation
necessary to deliver the best possible learning outcomes for all. This
year we recognizedf a new category of the top 25% of accepted papers as
"Exemplary papers", highlighted by the Program Chairs for their
accomplishment of high quality, novelty and broad appeal to reviewers.
The Program Chairs also selected three best papers, that each received
at least 2 of the highest rankings from reviewers. The Best CS Education
Research Paper is "Computing with CORGIS: Diverse, Real-world Datasets
for Introductory Computing" by Austin Bart, Ryan Whitcomb, Dennis
Kafura, Cliff Shaffer and Eli Tilevich. The Best New Program Paper is
"Infrastructure for Continuous Assessment of Retained Relevant
Knowledge" by Kathleen Timmerman and Travis Doom. The Best Experience
Report Paper is "Making Noise: Using Sound-Art to Explore Technological
Fluency" by Erik Brunvand and Nina McCurdy. There were 348 paper
submitted and 105 were accepted (30% acceptance rate). There were 1414
attendees! Here are the full submission statistics:\

The 22nd ITiCSE conference was held in Bologna, Italy on July 3-5, 2017.
The Conference Co-Chairs were Renzo Davoli (University of Bologna) and
Michael Goldweber (Xavier University). The Program Co-Chairs were Guido
Rößling (Technische Universität Darmstadt) and Irene Polycarpou
(University of Central Lancashire). The conference continues to be a
truly international conference with 241 submissions with a total of 554
authors from 40 countries on all continents: the authors came from
Africa (5), Asia (33), Europe (232), the Middle East (11), North America
including Central America and the Caribbean (189), Oceania (34), and
South America (50). A total of 175 papers, one panel, 31 posters, 18
tips & techniques and 16 working groups were submitted. This year, 56
papers (32%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the
proceedings along with 24 posters, 9 Tips and Techniques and 9 accepted
working groups. There were 228 attendees.

The 11th ICER conference was held August 18-20, 2017 in Tacoma,
Washington. The General Chairs were Josh Tenenberg and Donald Chinn
(both from University of Washington Tacoma), Judy Sheard (Monash

(Aalto University). There were a record 180 submissions with 29 papers
accepted for a 16% acceptance rate! There was a record 157 attendees!

One thing I\'ve neglected to mention about the ICER conference is the
Works In Progress Workshop co-located with ICER. This was started in
2014 as the Critical Research Review and was chaired by Colleen Lewis
(Harvey Mudd College). Somewhat like a Doctoral Consortium for faculty,
it has been held every year since and is now a permanent part of the
ICER program.

The 21st Doctoral Consortium was co-located with ICER and held on August
17, 2017. Leading the efforts were Ben Shapiro (University of Colorado,
Boulder) and Jan Vahrenhold (University of Münster). There were 20
participants.

Yadav, Jon Good, and Richard Enbody, from Michigan State University, and
the John Henry award to Elizabeth Patitsas, Jesse Berlin, Michelle
Craig, and Steve Easterbrook from University of Toronto. Picture of
Elizabeth in Australian bushman\'s hat.

The John Henry Award for the paper that in the judgement of the
conference participants attempts a task that may seem impossible and
pushes "the upper limits of our pedagogy" was presented to Elizabeth
Patitsas, Jesse Berlin, Michelle Craig, and Steve Easterbrook from the
University of Toronto for their paper "Evidence that Computer Science
Grades are not Bimodal". As is traditional with this award Elizabeth was
presented with a "typical" local hat, an Australian bushman's hat --
complete with swinging corks.

The 20th Doctoral Consortium was co-located with ICER and held on
September 8, 2016. Leading the efforts were Anthony Robins (University
of Otago) and Ben Shapiro (University of Colorado, Boulder). The

The Bulletin (Vol. 48, No. 2, April 2016) contained an article by
Michael Casperson explaining the \"Improved Reviewing Process for the
SIGCSE Technical Symposium\". Most conferences have a Program Committee
(PC) with personally invited members (typically in the range of 25\--50
people). The setup for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium is radically
different with a huge pool of ∼1,000 volunteers serving as reviewers.

From The Bulletin (Vol. 42, No. 3, September, 2010):\
![Bulletin-2010](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/ITiCSE-2010.jpg)

Since 2008, the ICER Fool\'s Award has been given for the paper with the
most interesting idea and/or most potential for impact on CS education
and CS Education research. This year\'s winners were Orni
Meerbaum-Salant, Michal Armoni, and Mordechai (moti) Ben-Ari for their
paper Learning Computer Science Concepts with Scratch. Among other
things, the paper introduces the idea of integrating the SOLO taxonomy
and Bloom\'s taxonomy as orthogonal taxonomies. Most people in the
audience were captured by the idea, which seems very promising and
useful. Picture of author in viking hat with horns.

The 14th Doctoral Consortium was held on August 8th in Aarhus with Lauri
Malmi (Aalto University) leading the efforts.

The March 2010 (Volume 42, Issue 1) brought a new format to the Bulletin
- a newsletter format. Here\'s a snapshot of the SIGCSE membership from
the same issue (reported 14 January 2010):

-   2624 members
-   members from 63 countries
-   2069 (78.9%) from the United States
-   94 from Canada
-   62 from the United Kingdom
-   49 from Scandinavia (21 from Sweden)
-   33 from Spain
-   32 from Australia
-   24 from Japan
-   22 from Germany
-   10-20 from Greece, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa,
    Taiwan and South Africa

Did you know that SIGCSE used to have several listservs? From The
Bulletin (Vol. 42, No. 2, June 2010) in addition to the two we have now
(SIGCSE-ANNOUNCE and SIGCSE-MEMBERS) we also had SIGCSE-COMMITTEES,
SIGCSE-MATH-COMM, SIGCSE-FACULTY-EVAL, SIGCSE-WOMEN-COMM and SIGCSE-CRM.
As use within each declined or the sub-committees finished their work
they were discontinued.

webmaster, Scott Grissom at Grand Valley State worked long and hard on
this transition.

The SIGCSE Board meets face-to-face twice a year (once at the Symposium)
and has begun almost monthly conference phone meetings. You can keep
abreast of our decision makings and deliberations, again by consulting
the website section at [http://sigcse.org/about](../../about.html)

The Volume 41, Issue 4, December 2009 was the last issue of Inroads as a
newsletter. Officially it was:

Welcome to this final edition of inroads -- the SIGCSE Bulletin. This
Volume 41, Number 4, 2009 December, issue represents the last time that
inroads (with lower case "i") will be synonymous with the SIGCSE
Bulletin. Starting in 2010, the SIGCSE Bulletin will continue with
Volume 42, Number 1 as an online newsletter. The "new" SIGCSE Bulletin
would contain news items related to SIGCSE and its operations as well as
other SIGCSE-related information. Starting in 2010, in addition to the
SIGCSE Bulletin, ACM will publish Volume 1, Number 1 of a magazine
called ACM Inroads (with upper case "I"). This new ACM magazine will
have content similar to inroads as found in this current 2009 December
issue. Columnists will continue to contribute to the publication;
invited editorials would continue to appear when appropriate.

There were several events co-located with the Symposium:

The 3rd Roundtable for Department Chairs was held on March 12, 2008. It
was led by Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University) and Frank Young
(Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.

There were two Doctoral Consortiums held this year - one co-located with
the Symposium and the second co-located with ICER. The 11th Doctoral
Consortium was held on March 12, 2008 and was led by Josh Tenenberg
(University of Washington, Tacoma) and Donald Joyce (UNITEC Institute of
Technology). The discussants were Chris Hundhausen (Washington State
University), Laurie Murphy (Pacific Lutheran University), Carsten
Schulte (Freie Universität Berlin), and Beth Simon (University of
British Columbia).

The DC participants were Suzanne Balik (North Carolina State
University), Kristy Boyer (North Carolina State University), William
Doane (University at Albany), Brian Dorn (Georgia Institute of
Technology), Cecily Heiner (University of Utah), Michael Hewner (Georgia
Institute of Technology), Jeremy Huddleston (University of California,

co-chairs were Ernestina Menasalvas and Raquel Martinez (both from
Universidad Politecnica de Madrid).

There were 150 papers submitted with 60 accepted for a 40% acceptance
rate. Dame Wendy Hall gave the opening keynote entitled \"What is web
science and why is it important?\" and 199 people attended. There were 5
working group reports.

The 4th ICER was held September 6-7, 2008 in Sydney, Australia. There
were 46 papers submitted with 16 accepted for a 35% acceptance rate and
52 people attended. The second triumvirate for ICER was Raymond Lister
(University of Technology Sydney), Michael Clancy (University of
California-Berkeley) and Michael Caspersen (Aarhus University). The
local person took care of all the arrangements when ICER was held at
their location, but all three were officially Conference Chairs and
Program Chairs (although you can find different names published in
different places).

Here are some pictures from ICER 2008:

The 12th Doctoral Consortium was held September 5, 2008 in Sydney when
the DC was relocated to be joint with ICER rather than the Technical
Symposium. The leaders of this DC were the same as earlier in the year:
Josh Tenenberg (University of Washington, Tacoma) and Donald Joyce
(UNITEC Institute of Technology). Thanks for doing double duty!

In Volume 40, Issue 2, June 2008 Inroads issue the discussion of
officially transitioning Inroads from "newsletter" to "magazine" began.
The Board proposed to: 1. Decouple the conference proceedings from
Inroads 2. Elevate Inroads to a \"magazine\" classification within ACM
3. Elevate the content to include papers of \"refereed\", \"formally
reviewed\", and \"reviewed\" status for all four quarterly issues. The
details were outlined in an email to the membership on March 13 and the
details were reprinted in the Peripherals section of this issue.

From the same issue, a new set of leaders for ICER were announced to
carry on the second 3-year host/leader cycle. Raymond Lister chaired
ICER '08 in Sydney, Australia. His co-chairs were Mike Clancy, the 2009
ICER chair, and Michael Caspersen, the 2010 chair.

Two international chapters of SIGCSE were launched this year -- an
Australasian chapter and a Spanish chapter.

From Inroads Volume 40, Issue 4, December 2008: The 2008 year saw us at
an all-time high for membership. JERIC transformed into a new
publication called Transactions on Computing Education.

The 3rd ICER was held September 15-16, 2007 at the Georgia Institute of
Technology in Atlanta, GA. The Conference and Program Chairs were again
the original triumvirate: Richard Anderson (University of Washington),
Sally Fincher (University of Kent at Canterbury), and Mark Guzdial
(Georgia Institute of Technology). There were 24 papers submitted with
14 accepted for a 58% acceptance rate. There were 71 attendees that
second year.

In the June 2007 (Volume 39, Number 2) Issue of Inroads, outgoing Chair
Henry Walker wrote a wonderful summary of the organization. Here are a
few highlights:

For many years up to 2001, SIGCSE had the highest retention rate of any
Special Interest Group (SIG) within the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM). However, SIGCSE was attracting relatively few new
members \-- even fewer than the small number leaving. Put together,
SIGCSE had 1908 members at the end of fiscal year 2001, after
experiencing a decade-long period of gradual decline in membership. This
placed SIGCSE as the ninth largest of approximately 34 SIGs. In 2001,
the Board changed directions to strongly encourage conference
participants to join SIGCSE through the strategic setting of
registration rates. The expectation was that many new members would seek
to retain their membership \-- if only we could get them started.
Additional efforts to increase member involvement and expand recruitment
are discussed below. Although the impact of specific initiatives is
difficult to assess, the organization seemed to be connecting well with
many in the computing community. At the end of the 2006 fiscal year
SIGCSE has 2587 members, an increase of about 35% over 2001, and now
ranked as the 4th largest SIG (just overtaking SIG PLAN by 27 members in
2006).

In April, the conference leadership for SIGCSE 2010 was announced and
current SIGCSE members were invited to volunteer to be part of future
program committees. Within 35 hours, 21 SIGCSE members had volunteered
\-- a wonderful testament to the interest of our membership in the
SIGCSE organization!

The Symposium and ITiCSE showed good growth:\
![38thTS-statistics](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/38thTS-statistics.jpg)

The SIGCSE Board raised annual dues from \$17 to \$25 in 1999, and dues
continue at that level today (for an electronic membership). This fee is
consciously set to attract members, but (alas) it does not fully cover
members costs. To balance budgets, SIGCSE traditionally has relied on
achieving a surplus on the annual symposium. In many earlier years,
symposia could achieve a profit of \$25,000 or so, through the diligence
and extraordinary efforts of conference leadership. More recently, the
symposia have become extremely successful with exhibitors, particularly
with the efforts of our exhibit management companies. At the same time,
we plan both the ITiCSE and ICER conferences to break even, and
sometimes a ITiCSE conference makes as much as a \$10,000. With careful
stewardship and with the resounding success of symposia and their
exhibits, SIGCSE finances have progressed remarkably since 2001. For
example, in 2001, SIGCSE\'s Fund Balance (reserve accounts with ACM) was
\$184,153.01; and ACM required a significant fraction of this to be held
in reserve to cover cash flow for conferences. SIGCSE was in a solid
financial position, but its reserves were only about 60% of annual
conference expenses and receipts. With on-going careful stewardship and
significant revenues from symposia exhibits, SIGCSE\'s Fund Balance at
the end of the 2006 fiscal year was \$438,699.04 \-- an increase of
about 138% since 2001. This level of financial expense has greatly
exceeded expectations \-- but it also has allowed the SIGCSE Board to
keep registration fees for SIGCSE symposia relatively low while
expanding SIGCSE programs and activities.

Special Projects: In 2002, through the vision of Sally Fincher and
others, SIGCSE initiated a program of Special Projects Grants "to
support members who wish to investigate and introduce new ideas in the
learning and teaching of computing." Grants are possible up to \$5,000
USD per proposal, and successful recipients are expected to present
their results at a SIGCSE conference.

In that same issue, Inroads published eleven papers on the topic of
Computer and Human Error (CHE). CHE opens a new area of computing. We
have all experienced computer human errors and now people are
researching and addressing this new area. I am delighted to share these
CHE works with you.

The December 2007 (Volume 39, Issue 4) Inroads premiered a new cover for
this and future publications. Slightly more graphic introductory pages
were also introduced as we moved toward modern times.\
![InroadsDecember2007](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/InroadsDecember2007.jpg)

That same issue included an Invited Editorial from Bill Manaris (College
of Charleston) reflecting on possible contributions to the falling
enrollments in computer science. How different from today!

Finally, here\'s part of poem, \" An Ode to Computing Educators at
SIGCSE\" by Tony Clear. It was recited to the SIGCSE award recipients at
a dinner in Covington, Kentucky, March 8, 2007:

SIGCSE a group of fine people\
Scholars who share humanity\
Through their love of others\
Love for learning\
And love of teaching.\
No matter what their age,\
Through firm personal conviction,\
Mentoring life long learning.

Knowing that\
To truly learn

First\
Must come\
Or be developed

The thirst.

So,

Blessed are those who thirst\
But even more so\
Blessed are the thirst makers.

Tony Clear\

conference saying I promised my kids I would send them a picture of my
friends. Included in the front you can see my co-chair Deb Knox and the
Program Chairs Tom Naps and Wanda Dann.\"

There were 320 papers submitted, with 90 accepted (28% acceptance rate)
and there were 1228 attendees.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Mordechai Ben-Ari** for his contributions as a textbook
author, mentor and pedagogical researcher at both the university and
pre-college levels, in concurrency, formal methods, and programming
languages. Moti couldn\'t attend the conference, so the keynote was
actually delivered by Owen Astrachan (Duke University) and featured a
great game of identifying people from their pictures.

You can listen to an interview with Moti through the Computing Educators
Oral History Project here:
[http://ahab.southwestern.edu/departments/mathcompsci/OHProject/benAriM-o\...](http://ahab.southwestern.edu/departments/mathcompsci/OHProject/benAriM-overview.html)

The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to Bruce
Klein to recognize him for exemplary service to ACM, extraordinary
commitment to SIGCSE, and mentoring of SIGCSE members. He served on ACM
SIG Board task forces, the ACM Education Board, the SIGCSE Executive
Board 2001 to 2007 as chair and past chair, was a past ITiCSE Conference
and Technical Symposium chair, and multiple program committees.

College of New Jersey) were the Program Co-Chairs. There were over 153
papers submitted with 46 accepted (

In Volume 36, Issue 2, June 2004 issue of The Bulletin, Chair Henry
Walker wrote the following, most of which is still true today:

> The SIGCSE Board formally approves event sites. For ITiCSE, interested
> SIGCSE members initiate proposals for holding conferences at their
> universities in Europe, and SIGCSE representatives .. work with local
> leaders to refine site details. In contrast, SIGCSE chooses locations
> for its symposia in the US through a bidding process, coordinated by
> ACM staff and a SIGCSE volunteer. For all events, the SIGCSE Board
> devotes considerable attention to finding appropriate facilities at

### 1998<a name="#1998"></a>

The 29th Technical Symposium was held February 25 - March 1, 1998 in
Atlanta, GA. From The Bulletin Volume 30 Issue 1, March 1998:\
![Program Committee of the 29nd Technical
Symposium](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/29thTS-committee.jpg)\
![Submission statistics for the 29nd Technical
Symposium](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/29thTS-statistics.jpg)\
There were 901 attendees at the Technical Symposium in 1998.\
The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **William Wulf**, for his contributions to the advancement of
Computer Science Education in engineering.\
The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to
**Della Bonnette**, a past chair of SIGCSE and Technical Symposium chair
and editor of the SIGCSE bulletin, and for her leadership in
accreditation including chairing CSAC, years on CSAB Board of Directors,
ACM SIG Board, and area director.\
SIGCSE \'98 introduced several new features. As documented in the
welcome in the proceedings (The Bulletin Volume 30 Issue 1, March
1998):\
![Program Committee of the 29nd Technical
Symposium](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/29thTS-chair%20message.jpg)\
The conference activities were extended to Saturday, as many attendees
requested in the past. The SIGCSE Town Meeting was held on Saturday
morning, is a new event this year which gave everyone an opportunity to
express their thoughts on the future of computing education. The student
poster competition became part of the official program and specific
events for first time attendees of the conference were held to ensure
that they feel the camaraderie of the SIGCSE community. Workshops and
posters were also published (
<https://portalparts.acm.org/280000/274790/bm/backmatter.pdf?ip=174.74.49.67>).

On Wednesday, the day before the conference officially began, the first
ever Doctoral Consortium was held. Vicki Almstrum (University of Texas
at Austin) and Marian Petre (Open University) ran the first DC. The aims
of the Doctoral Consortium were:

-   To offer a friendly forum for students to discuss their work and
    receive constructive feedback.
-   To offer relevant information on issues important to doctoral
    candidates.
-   To nurture a community of researchers.

The Consortium was designed for Ph.D. students in any area of Computing
who plan to have a career in academia. All participants gave short
presentations of their research ideas or ongoing research. Small group
discussions, a round-table discussion, and presentations by specialists
in the field allowed participants to exchange ideas, explore relevant
issues, discuss strategies for completion, and prepare for the
challenges of an effective career in higher education. Some notable
attendees of that first Doctoral Consortium included Anders Berglund,
Christina Björkman, and Mats Daniels (Uppsala University), Lisa
Kaczmarczyk (Chemeketa Community College), and Laurie Williams
(University of Utah).

The 3rd ITiCSE was held at Dublin City University in Ireland, in
cooperation with SIGCUE and in conjunction with the 6th Annual
Conference on the Teaching of Computing. Gordon Davies (Open University)
and Mícheál O hÉigeartaigh (Dublin City University) were Conference
Co-Chairs. Mats Daniels (Uppsala University) was Program Chair and Dan
Joyce (Villanova University) was Working Groups Coordinator. There were
more than 200 attendees. There were 59 papers accepted and 5 Working
Groups. Thanks to Dan Joyce we have the following pictures:\
![ITiCSE 1998 Working Group

Speaking of Working groups, there is a website created by Vicki Almstrum
( <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/csed/iticse/iticse-by-year.html>) that
has a list of all the working groups from 1996 - 2003, including
pictures!

Inroads was officially introduced
(<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=292422>) (
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=292422>). From Volume 30 Issue 2,
June 1998: \"SIGCSE has renewed its cooperation with NECC, but in a
limited capacity. NECA, the coordinating group for NECC, changed its
bylaws to permit organizational members in a non-voting capacity. We
have chosen to join in this way. It means that we still can participate
in NECC planning, while not being required to provide sessions or
speakers. ... The SIGCSE email distribution list has more than 600
recipients and traffic is quite heavy at times.\" In addition, the
Working Group reports from ITiCSE were published in the December 1998
issue of Inroads.

Thanks to Bob Beck for these notes and Vicki Almstrum for passing this
along.\
![ Notes about the 28nd Technical
Symposium](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/28thTS.jpg)

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Andrew Tannenbaum** for seminal textbooks in networks,
computer organization and operating systems, outstanding wit and
educational leadership.

It was in 1997 that the **SIGCSE Award for Lifetime Service to the
Computer Science Education Community** was established. This award
honors an individual who has a long history of volunteer service to the
computer science education community. The service is not limited to
SIGCSE service and may take many forms, such as professional society
leadership, conference organization, outreach efforts, editorial board
participation, or any of a number of other types of service to the
computer science education community. The award may recognize service at
any level (K-12, college, graduate, or continuing post-college).

The First Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education Award was
bestowed upon **Dick Austing** who was editor on several curriculum
recommendation documents in almost every area of computer science,
including Curriculum \'78, 2-year Task Force Report. He also served as
registrar for many SIGCSE conferences both before and after computerized
registration. He served as the SIGCSE Technical Symposium chair and was
a founding ACM Fellow.

You can listen to an interview with Dick through the Computing Educators
Oral History Project here:

The 2nd ITiCSE conference was held in Uppsala, Sweden on June 2-4, 1997.
Lillian N. Cassel (Villanova University) and Mats Daniels (Uppsala
University) were the Conference Co-Chairs. There were 123 papers
submitted with 43 accepted (34.1% acceptance rate). There were 7 Working
Groups. Here\'s a picture of one of the working groups from Dan Joyce:\
![Working Group at ITiCSE
1997](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/ITiCSE-WG-1997.jpg)\
As proof of the international growth of the organization, from the June
1997 Bulletin (Vol. 29, Issue 2):\
![Bulletin June
1997](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinJune1997-1.jpg)\
The other very exciting thing that happened in 1997, The Bulletin
officially acquired a new theme: Inroads, as well as the familiar format
we\'re now used to for Inroads, including the columns (Vol 29, Issue 4,
Dec. 1997):\
![Bulletin June
1997](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinJune1997-2.jpg)\
And we acquired Editor Emeriti (ibid):\

### 1996<a name="#1996"></a>

From Vol 26, Issue 3, Sept. 1994 Bulletin:\
![Bulletin announcement of first
ITiCSE](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinSept1994.jpg)\
This year marks the beginning of the ITiCSE Conference (Innovation and
Technology in Computer Science Education). It has been held annually
since, usually in late June or early July. This conference brings
together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in
computing education. In addition to invited lectures, paper, panel,
poster and \"tips & techniques\" sessions, the conference provides
facilities and exposure for working groups of up to ten members, whose
final reports may be published by SIGCSE. Exhibits and tutorials are
also offered. Plus good food, good company and interesting locales. If
you have never been to an ITiCSE, do yourself a favor and go. You will
not regret it!

**The typical ITiCSE Schedule:**

-   Saturday Working groups arrive and meet
-   Sunday Working groups meet, delegates arrive, opening reception
-   Monday Conference opening, Keynote speech, followed by a full day of
    sessions
-   Tuesday A.M.: Plenary meeting followed by sessions
-   Tuesday P.M.: Tourist excursion(s)
-   Tuesday Evening: Conference Dinner
-   Wednesday Plenary meeting followed by a full day of sessions
-   Poster sessions at coffee breaks Monday through Wednesday.

The first ITiCSE was held in Barcelona, Spain on June 2-5, 1996. Lillian
N Cassel (Villanova University) and Jim Hightower (California State
University at Fullerton) were the Co-Conference Chairs. There were 46
papers accepted and there were 5 Working Groups. Here we have a picture
of the Working Group on Labs from Dan Joyce:\
![Working Group at ITiCSE
1996](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/ITiCSE-WG-1996.jpg)

27th Technical Symposium was held February 15-18, 1996 in Philadelphia,
PA. Conference Chair: John Impagliazzo (Hofstra University); Program
Chair: Elizabeth Adams (Richard Stockton College). Panels Chair was Joan
S. Langdon (Bowie State University). Henry M. Walker (Grinnell College)
served as Seminars Chair. Workshops Chair was Margaret M. Reek
(Rochester Institute of Technology). Posters Chair was Nancy L.
Hagelgans (Ursinus College). Birds of a Feather Chair was Steve Drasner
(Northern Virginia Community College - Annandale). Karl J. Klee

Arrangements were handled by Elliot B. Koffman (Temple University). The
Evaluations Chair was Linda Hayden (Elizabeth City State College) and
Patricia A. Woodworth (Ithaca College) served as the Treasurer while
Mats Daniels (Uppsala University) was the International Coordinator.
There were 205 papers submitted and 78 accepted (38% acceptance rate).
23 panels were submitted with 16 accepted (69% acceptance rate). 13
seminars were submitted with 9 accepted (69% acceptance rate). 24
workshops submitted with 16 accepted (66% acceptance rate). There were
20 posters and 6 BOFs with 795 attendees.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Nell Dale**, for being a prolific author for introductory
computer science textbooks and contributions to the field of computer
science education research. Her keynote was entitled \"Research in
Computer Science Education: Five Case Studies.\"

You can listen to an interview with Nell Dale through the Computing
Educators Oral History Project here:\
<http://ahab.southwestern.edu/departments/mathcompsci/OHProject/daleN-overview.html>

The other keynote at the Technical Symposium that year was presented by
John A.N. Lee: \"The Forgotten Tool of Computer Science
Education\--History\". Other interesting facts about the 1996 Technical
Symposium (thanks to John Impagliazzo):

-   It was the Launch of ACM 50th anniversary.
-   Extended workshops to Sunday morning.
-   First time BOFs were published in the proceedings.
-   Featured a chess match between Kasparov and IBM Deep Blue.
-   The reception on Thursday night featured carving stations and
    classical music - harp, violin, and piano.

There were also some unexpected difficulties associated with the
Symposium. A snow storm disrupted arrivals on Thursday and Friday. On
Tuesday, Symposium Chair John Impagliazzo was notified that Vice
President Al Gore was to do the symbolic start of the ENIAC. We were
told to evacuate three floors at the Marriott Wednesday and Thursday
without alternative housing for SIGCSE people. Panic mode set in!
Fortunately, Al Gore cancelled Wednesday morning. Phew! John shared his
hotel room with others due to flight cancellations because of the snow.
And Nell Dale had her first snowball fight with John, and won :-)

The proceedings for the conferences actually took up 2 issues of The
Bulletin (Volume 23, Issue 1, March 1996) for the Technical Symposium
Proceedings and Volume 28, Issue Special Issue for the ITiCSE '96
proceedings which included posters and demonstrations.

### 1995<a name="#1995"></a>

The year is 1995 and our Board from 1993 continued as ACM allowed SIG
officers to extend their term another 2 years if they wished, without an
election. Our Board all wished to extend: Chair: Lillian \"Boots\"
Cassel (Villanova University); Vice-Chair: G. Michael Schneider
(Macalester College); Secretary/Treasurer: Henry Walker (Grinnell
College); Board: Janet Hartman (US Air Force Academy), Margaret Reek

College). James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued at
the Bulletin Editor.

The 26th Technical Symposium was held March 2-4 (3 days!), 1995 in
Nashville, TN at the Opryland Hotel Complex. The Conference Chairs were
Cary Laxer (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology) and Frank Young
(Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology). Yes, that\'s right they were the
program chairs just 2 years earlier! They must have really enjoyed the
job given the fact they signed up again so quickly! The Program Chair
was Judith Gersting (Indiana University-Purdue University at
Indianapolis / University of Hawaii at Hilo). There were 215 papers
submitted with 75 accepted (35% acceptance rate) as well as 24 panels
and 3 tutorials.

An interesting fact from this Technical Symposium: SIGCSE members
wearing conference badges were constantly accosted by tourists because
they thought \"ACM\" was the Academy of Country Music!

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to **Robert Aiken**, for being an outstanding mentor, advocate of
computer science and contributions to technology education both in the
United States and abroad.

talking about "Computer Science Education: Past, Present, Future" and
William H. Graves (UNC Chapel Hill) spoke on "Learning Productivity:
Medium and Message."

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to Norman Gibbs (Carnegie Mellon University) for his contribution
to Software Engineering Education, being the first director of the
Software Engineering Institute, and co-founder of the Liberal Arts
Computer Science Consortium.

From Vol 26, Issue 3, Sept. 1994 Bulletin contains the first mention of
"electronic messages sent to the SIGCSE members," the origination of our
listserv!

### 1993<a name="#1993"></a>

In the elections of 1993, Lillian \"Boots\" Cassel (Villanova
University) was elected Chair, G. Michael Schneider (Macalester College)
became Vice-Chair and Henry Walker (Grinnell College) became the
Secretary/Treasurer. Elected Board members were Janet Hartman (US Air
Force Academy), Margaret Reek (Rochester Institute of Technology) and,
J. Paul Myers (Trinity University in San Antonio). James Miller
(University of Southern Mississippi) continued at the Bulletin Editor.

The 24th Technical Symposium was held February 18-19, 1993 in
Indianapolis, IN at the Indianapolis Convention Center. Conference Chair
was Bruce J. Klein (Grand Valley State University). Program Chairs were
Cary Laxer and Frank Young (both from Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology). Panels were overseen by Margaret Reek (Rochester Institute
of Technology). Workshops were handled by G. Michael Schneider
(Macalaster College) and Paul Carter (University of British Columbia).
Birds of a Feather were chaired by Kenneth Johnson (Grand Valley State
University). The conference Treasurer was Paul Jorgensen (Grand Valley
State University) and Evaluations were done by Paul Leidig (Grand Valley
State University). Anyone else notice the pattern between having a
Technical Symposium leadership position and then being elected to the
Board?

There were 204 papers submitted and 60 were accepted for 29.4%
acceptance rate (!). There were also 24 panels, 3 tutorials, and 11
workshops. Because of the increase in submissions, the Board voted to
expand the program to add an additional paper track for the following
year.

The keynotes that year were given by Alan Kay and Elliot Soloway.
Elliot\'s talk was entitled "Should Non-CS Majors Learn Programming?"
(How prophetic!)

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to Alan Kay (Apple Computer) for his contributions to Smalltalk
programming languages, and research development of computers usable by
children.

We might consider this to be the year of addressing female
underrepresentation in computing. There were many conference and
Bulletin articles on the subject.

### 1992<a name="#1992"></a>

The 23rd Technical Symposium held March 5-6, 1992 in Kansas City, MO
with the theme "Networking for Knowledge." The Conference Chair was
Maynard J. Mansfield (Indiana University - Purdue University at Fort
Wayne). The Program Chairs were Curt M. White (Indiana University-Purdue
University at Fort Wayne) and Janet Hartman (Illinois State University
Program). Cary Laxer (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology) headed up the
Panels and Ken Modesitt (Western Kentucky University) oversaw Workshops.
Larry Cottrell (University of Central Florida) oversaw the Birds of a
Feather. Bob Barett (Indiana/Purdue University at Fort Wayne) was the
Treasurer and Anne Pierce (Georgia Southern University) handled
Evaluations.

There were 60 papers accepted along with 20 panels and 8 posters. There
were 702 attendees.

Keynotes were delivered by Daniel D. McCracken (City College of New
York) "On Programming Languages in the Computer Science Curriculum" and
Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin) "My Vision is Your Vision."
Other interesting tidbits from this conference: there were 6 concurrent
sessions and the first "official" SIGCSE Social on Thursday night of the
conference occurred. Before this conference it was considered a private
party and not part of the official conference program. With this
conference it officially became part of the conference.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to Daniel McCracken, author of numerous best-selling books on
Fortran, COBOL and other languages and for their profound influence on
current computer science teachers.

You can listen to an interview with Dan through the Computing Educators
Oral History Project here:
<http://ahab.southwestern.edu/departments/mathcompsci/OHProject/mccrackenD-overview.html>.

The June 1992 issue of The Bulletin (Volume 24, Issue 2) contains
information on the 1991 ACM Scholastic Programming Contest Finals
(Stanford won). This was the first contest to break the "sneaker-net"
barrier (program submissions over a network vs. disks)!

In The December 1992 issue of The Bulletin (Volume 24, Issue 4, doi
10.1145/141837.141838) Chair Nell Dale presents the results of the 6
page membership survey conducted earlier in the year. Interesting to me
was that 49% of the responses indicated that SIGCSE should "actively
recruit high school teachers who teach APCS." The survey also included
questions about SIGCSE sponsoring activities outside the
US...foreshadowing of the ITiCSE conference! Also, check out the
responses to areas of research:\
![ Logo for 22nd Technical
Symposium](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/1992-research-areas.png)

Another topic brought up in the survey was what SIGCSE could do to add
validity to research in Computer Science Education. Evidence of our
growing pains.

### 1991<a name="#1991"></a>

Did you know that the current ACM President was once a SIGCSE officer??
Yep!

Elections were held in 1991 and we elected the following: Nell Dale
(University of Texas at Austin) was elected Chair, Lillian (\"Boots\")
Cassel (Villanova University) was elected Vice-Chair; and Harriet Taylor
(Louisiana State University) was elected Secretary/Treasurer. Elected
Board members were Steve Cunningham (California State University,
Stanislaus), Cherri Pancake (Auburn University), and Angela Shiflet
(Wofford College). The Bulletin Editor continued to be James Miller
(University of Southern Mississippi).

The 22nd Technical Symposium held March 7-8, 1991 in San Antonio, TX at
the San Antonio Convention Center. The Conference Chair was Nell Dale
(University of Texas at Austin). The Program Chairs were John and Laurie
Werth (The University of Texas at Austin). Panels and Special Sessions
were chaired by Daniel Canas (Wake Forest University). Workshops were
chaired by Henry Walker (Grinnell College). Birds of a Feather were
chaired by Joyce Brennan (University of Texas at Austin). Treasurer for
the conference was Chris Edmondson-Yurkanan (University of Texas at
Austin) and Local Arrangements were handled by Suzy Gallagher
(University of Texas at Austin) and J. Paul Myers (Trinity University).\
![ Logo for 22nd Technical
Symposium](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/22ndTSlogo.png)\
There were 175 papers submitted, and 60 accepted for 34.3% acceptance
rate. There were 11 panels, 1 special session and 43 posters. Attendance
for the conference was 734.

The theme for the conference was "Education, Research, Industry: Keep
the Information Flowing." Key notes were given by David Gries (Cornell
University) and William Wulf (University of Virginia).

The Friday luncheon was held again, with over 400 people in attendance
(Bulletin, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 1991). This article, by out-going
chair Elliot Koffman also mentions the growth of the Saturday workshops.
The dues for the following year were increased to \$16.50. SIGCSE
Membership was, and still is, a bargain!

In the December, 1991 issue of The Bulletin (Volume 23, Issue 4), new
Chair Nell Dale noted that SIGCSE had the highest member retention rate
(92%) of any of the ACM SIGs! SIGCSE had approximately 2600 members.
This issue also includes detailed minutes of several Board Meetings.

### 1990<a name="#1990"></a>

In 1990 we celebrated the 21st birthday of SIGCSE along with our 21st
Technical Symposium. We celebrated February 22-23 in Washington, DC at
the Sheraton Washington Hotel. The Conference theme was "From Generation
to Generation." The Conference Co-Chairs were Richard H. Austing
(University of Maryland) and Lillian N. Cassel (Villanova University).
It was held in conjunction with the ACM CSC (February 20-22) and Post
Symposium Workshops were held on February 24th. The Program Chair was
Gayle Yaverbaum (Temple University) for Papers. Harriet Taylor
(Louisiana State University) chaired Panels, Tutorials, Case Studies;
Joyce Currie Little (Towson State University) chaired Special Events;
Donald Gotterbarn (Wichita State) and James Swanson (New Hampshire
College) chaired the Birds of a Feather sessions; Dan Joyce (Villanova
University) headed up Publications and Local Arrangements were handled
by Elizabeth Adams (American University) and Pat Woodworth (Ithaca
College). This is the beginning of our current Conference Committee
format.

Here's part of the advertisement I found in the Bulletin (Volume 21,
Issue 4, Dec. 1989):\
![December 1989 Bulletin
](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinDec1989.jpg)\
There were 120 papers submitted, 52 accepted, for a 43.3% acceptance
rate. There were 17 panels, 3 tutorials and 3 workshops listed in the
final proceedings. A total of 756 people attended. This was the first
year of the Friday luncheon -- which we've had ever since at the
Technical Symposium.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to the **Curriculum \'68 Committee** (William F. Atchison, Chair;
Samuel D. Conte, John W. Hamblen, Thomas E. Hull, Thomas A. Keenan,
William B. Kehl, Edward J. McCluskey, Silvio O. Navarro, Werner C.
Rheinboldt, Earl J. Schweppe, William Viavant, David M. Young, Jr.)

For their work on the seminal document leading the way for the founding
of a multitude of computer science departments and providing guidance to
the formation of courses and production of textbooks.

There were two key notes: William Atchison gave one entitled "Revisting
our Roots: Curriculum '68 and Beyond" and Robert M Aiken and James Adams
gave one entitled "Coming of Age".

In the September, 1990 (Volume 22, Issue 3) of The Bulletin, the Karl V.
Karlstrom Award for the Outstanding Educator in Computer Science Award
was announced.

In the December, 1990 (Volume 22, Issue 4) of The Bulletin, the 1990 ACM
Scholastic Programming Contest Finals sponsored by AT&T Computer Systems
is highlighted including the winning teams (University of Otago New
Zealand won), the computing specifications (each team was provided with
its own AT&T 6386 WorkGroup System, only Pascal solutions allowed) and
the problems. Check out this link if you're interested.

### 1989<a name="#1989"></a>

It is 1989 and the 20th Technical Symposium (still joint with ACM
Computer Science Conference) was held February 21-23 at the Commonwealth
Convention Center in Louisville, KY. The SIGCSE theme was "Racing to the
Future".\
![1989 ACM Computer Science Conference front
cover](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/20thTS.jpg)\
The Conference Chair was John Gorgone (Bentley College). Maynard
Mansfield and Robert Barrett (both from Indiana University -- Purdue
University at Fort Wayne) served as Program Co-Chairs. John Schrage
(Southern Illinois University -- Edwardsville) was Chair of Panels; Don
Chand (Bentley College) was Chair for Case Studies and Tutorials; Dennis
Anderson (Bentley College) was Treasurer; and S. Srinivasan helped with
Local Arrangements.

A total of 181 papers were submitted with 60 accepted (33% acceptance
rate) and there were 14 panels and 2 workshops.

The 1989 Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was
awarded to **Edsger Dijkstra** for providing clarity about programs
through his letter **\"GOTO Considered Harmful\"** and writings on
structured programming and the effects of these works on the emergence
of formal methods as integral to computer science education.

There were also elections, but the entire same Board was elected, so
they must have been doing an excellent job! Continuing as Chair was
Elliot Koffman (Temple University); Vice-Chair was Nell Dale (University
of Texas at Austin); Secretary/Treasurer was Robert Cupper (Allegheny
College). The Board of Directors continued to be: Lillian Cassel
(Villanova University), A. Joe Turner (Clemson University), and Joyce
Currie Little (Towson State University).

James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued as the
Editor of the Bulletin.

### 1988<a name="#1988"></a>

The year is 1988 and the 19th Technical Symposium was held in Atlanta,
GA at the Westin Peachtree Plaza on February 25-26. The Conference Chair
was Betty Jehn (University of Dayton) and the Program Chair was Herb
Dershem (Hope College). Angela Shiflet (Wofford College) served as the
Panels Chair and Verlynda Dobbs (Wright State University) served as the
Treasurer for the conference.

Here\'s the breakdown for the submissions for the year:

Papers: 63 accepted, 171 submitted, acceptance rate of 37%. 15 panels
accepted 2 tutorials accepted:\
![Acceptance rates for 1988
Symposium](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/Symposium1988.jpg)

The 1988 Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was
awarded to Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper for her pioneering work in
compiler design (Cobol), her efforts to oversee the Navy\'s efforts to
maintain uniformity in programming languages over two decades, and a
master teacher who reminded us to watch our nanoseconds.

We have this story from Elliot Koffman, then Chair of SIGCSE:

> I spent an unforgettable morning with Joyce (Little Currie)
> interviewing Grace Murray Hopper prior to her receiving the SIGCSE
> award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education. She
> was unable to attend the meeting to receive the award for health
> reasons but we played the video tape of the interview and it was very
> well received. Many copies of the tape were requested and sent to CS
> and Info Sci departments after the meeting.

Elliot thinks he has a copy of the Grace Murray Hopper interview video,
but is unable to get it to eject from his VCR. If someone else has an
old copy, please let me know - this is definitely something we would
want to transfer to digital to have for posterity!

In the Volume 20, Issue 2, June 1988 Bulletin was a financial report
that listed the SIGCSE membership at 2,521 members!

### 1987<a name="#1987"></a>

In 1987 the 18th Technical Symposium was held February 19-20 in St.
Louis, MO. The Conference Chair was Dan St. Clair (University of
Missouri at Rolla Graduate Center). A.K. Rigler (University of Missouri
at Rollla) served as Program Chair and Robert A. Barrett (Indiana
University Purdue University at Fort Wayne) was the BOF and Special
Sessions Chair. A total of 93 papers were accepted (a big jump from the
previous year's 51!).

The 1987 Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was
awarded to **Niklaus Wirth** for the development of a series of
programming languages mainly for use in education chief among them
Pascal. These languages continue to have a profound effect on the
teaching of programming and on computer science in general.

We also held elections. Elected as Chair was Elliot Koffman (Temple
University); Vice-Chair was Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin);
Secretary/Treasurer was Robert Cupper (Allegheny College). The Board of
Directors elected were the same from the previous board: Lillian Cassel
(Villanova University), A. Joe Turner (Clemson University), and Joyce
Currie Little (Towson State University).

Della Bonnette would have rotated to the Past President position. A
quick Google search reveals that she was on a SIGCSE panel in 2000
talking about ABET and is still involved with ABET/CSAB.

James Miller (University of Southern Mississippi) continued as the
Editor of the Bulletin. Sadly, 1987 also marked the end of the
"President's Notes" in the Bulletin which has been the source of a lot
of great information!

### 1986<a name="#1986"></a>

In 1986 the 17th Technical Symposium was held February 6-7 in
Cincinnati, OH at the Clarion Hotel. The Conference Chair was Richard H.
Austing (University of Maryland). The Program Chairs were Joyce Currie
Little (Towson State Univ) and Lillian N. Cassel (University of
Delaware). Bruce J. and Georgianna T. Klein (Grand Valley State College)
served as the Special Sessions Chairs. Over 100 papers were submitted
and 51 were accepted. A fun fact about this Technical Symposium -- it
included a German Festival!

Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded to
**Donald Knuth** for authoring the influential series the \"Art of
Computer Programming\" and his continuing contributions including TeX
publication tool. His keynote talk was entitled "Theory and Practice"
and was delivered before approximately 1000 attendees of the joint ACM
Computer Science / SIGCSE Conference.

Here's a story about John Impagliazzo's initial foray into SIGCSE:\

> I only got involved with SIGCSE in the mid-1980s when Joyce Currie
> Little dragged me to the Thursday evening celebration and made me
> (forced me to) dance with many of the SIGCSE dignitaries (Boots,
> Della, Nell, Joyce, etc.) at the SIGCSE (German) Symposium in
> Cincinnati. I happened to sit between Jim Miller (SIGCSE Bulletin EIC)
> and Nell Dale. The rest is history. Dick Austing had something to do
> with all this also.

We are thankful those SIGCSE dignitaries roped you in!

### 1985<a name="#1985"></a>

In 1985 we elected new officers: Della Bonnette (University of
Southwestern Louisiana) for Chair, Elliott Koffman (Temple University)
for Vice-Chair, Robert Cupper (Allegheny College) for
Secretary/Treasurer. The At-Large members elected were Lillian Cassel
(Goldey Beacom College), A. Joe Turner (Clemson University), and Joyce
Currie Little (Towson State University).

James Miller (University of West Florida) continued as Bulletin Editor.
Here's an idea of what submissions were like (from the Volume 17 Issue
2, June 1985 Bulletin):\
*At present most accepted papers are retyped on a word processor. We are
attempting to standardize the format to single-spaced, double Column
copy in prestige elite typeface, with 10 characters/inch, with 42
characters/line, and with right and left margin justification. Single
column format is 89 characters/line.*\
*We then print them on standard white computer paper and do a
\"cut-and-paste\" layout on camera-ready matte sheets which are
photographically reduced 25 percent. ... Copy may be typed directly on
the sheets and is correctable with Snopake, or you can use
cut-and-paste.*\
*I will ask you to send any graphs, tables, or figures in camera-ready
form and to remember that the 25 percent reduction may reduce their
effectiveness. Small illustrations may be drawn directly on the matte
sheets with a black felt-tipped pen or attached with rubber cement.*

The 16th Technical Symposium was held March 12-14, 1985 in New Orleans,
LA at the Marriott Hotel. The Conference Chair was Della T. Bonnette
(University of Southwest Louisiana). The Program Chair was Harriet G.
Taylor (Louisiana State University) and Nell Dale (University of Texas
Austin) served as the Special Sessions Chair. A total of 68 papers were
accepted. The proceedings are in the first issue of the Bulletin for
1985. Interesting for me, I think I found the first work on cognition in
programming at SIGCSE:

COGNITIVE PROCESSES IN PROGRAMMING MODERATOR: Laurie Werth (UNLV)
:   This panel will discuss (a) the cognitive processes used in computer
    programming (b) how to use these processes in teaching computer
    science. Laurie Werth will introduce the panel members and give a
    brief background of work in this area. A short review of studies
    predicting success in beginning computer science classes, as well as
    copies of two computer science placement examinations, will be
    available as handouts.\
    Barry Kurtz (New Mexico State) will briefly describe Piaget\'s
    intellectual development levels and a computer science test which he
    has designed to measure the correspondence between Piaget\'s levels
    and success in a beginning programming class. Dave Scanlan (Illinois
    State) will discuss the differences between right and left brain
    cognitive abilities and the need for tapping right brain abilities
    in teaching computer science. Saj-nicole Joni (Yale University) will
    present a brief overview of the cognitive methodology used in
    cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence research. Using the
    programming knowledge which has been identified, she will present
    some ideas on helping novice programmers to correct non-buggy
    programs. Jeff Bonar (University of Pittsburgh) will discuss
    cognitive elements in programming which he has measured and then
    explain a plan-based intelligent tutoring environment which he
    developed for beginning programmers.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded
to Elliot Organick. He was given the award as the Founder of SIGCSE,
author and disseminator of the MULTICS operating system, and author of
several widely disseminated textbooks in programming languages and first
computer courses.

Here's another great story from Frank Friedman:\

> I am not sure when this happened, but probably the early 80s. I was
> the Allegheny Regional Rep to ACM Council when we had several naming
> discussions for our dear old Association, principally because of
> concerns that the word Machinery was in the name. So in my quarterly
> newsletter to ACM Members in the Allegheny Region and wrote a little
> blurb about this discussion and asked for member feedback concerning
> the name. I got only three responses which right there told me what I
> needed to know. But all three responses pretty much asked whether
> Council had better things to do. And two of the three changed my name
> from Frank to Fred.

And that was that. Now I have two names.

Frank er, I mean Fred

### 1984<a name="#1984"></a>

The 15th Technical Symposium was held February 16-17, 1984 in
Philadelphia, PA at the Franklin Plaza Hotel. The Chair was Richard H.
Austing (University of Maryland). Joyce Currie Little (Towson State
University) served as the Refereed Papers Chair and Lillian N. Cassel
(Goldey Beacom College) served as the Special Sessions Chair. There were
94 papers submitted and 36 were accepted (38% acceptance rate). There
were 8 panels and 2 special sessions. The conference luncheon featured
the awards being given to the winners of the final round of the Eighth
Annual International Scholastic Programming Contest and to the second
recipient of the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. The invited speaker at
the luncheon was Dr. Gwen Bell of The Computer Museum of Boston.

The conference was held jointly with the CSC and our own Frank Friedman
was the General Chairperson of the CSC that year! According to Frank:
"Most of the CSC Committee were women and they were REALLY GOOD people.
They were the brains behind the operation and they did all the work. I
just scheduled meetings, they basically ran the show."

Interestingly, the keynotes for the CSC were also computing education
related:

-   Daniel D. McCracken: A Skeptical View of Computer Literacy
-   Mary Shaw: Goals for Computer Science Education in the 1980\'s

Because Frank was the CSC Chair that year, he was able to provide the
following pictures:\

Unfortunately, I found no record of the recipient of the Outstanding
Contribution to Computer Science Education for 1983. Frank sent this
picture of Marshall Yovits presenting Orrin Taulbee with an ACM award,
but I don't think it's ours:\

### 1983<a name="#1983"></a>

In February 17-18, 1983 the 14th Technical Symposium was held in
Orlando, FL. The Conference Chair was Larry Cottrell (University of
Central Florida). The Program Chairs were A. Joe Turner (Clemson
University) and Sheau-Dong Lang (University of Central Florida). There
were 84 papers submitted with 59 accepted, yielding a 70.2% acceptance
rate.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education was awarded
to Karl Karlstrom (Prentice-Hall) for being a book editor who piloted
some 500 books on computer science through the publication process at a
time when a senior editor said, \"I have traveled the length and breadth
of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you
that data processing is a fad that won\'t last out the year.\" If you
want to read his remarks, check out the June 1983 issue of the Bulletin
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382188>. This issue also contains
the 1983 International Programming Contest problems.

In that same June issue of the Bulletin, a list of the places where the
Bulletin was mailed was presented:\

### 1982<a name="#1982"></a>

James Miller (University of West Florida) began his first of eight terms
as the Bulletin Editor.

On February 11-12, 1982 the 13th Technical Symposium was held in
Indianapolis, IN. The Conference Chair was John Dalphin, (Indiana
University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne). The Program Chairs were
Robert A. Barrett (Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne)
and John T. Gorgone (Bentley College). There was a 69.3% acceptance rate
with 75 papers submitted and 52 accepted. There were 429 pre-registered
participants.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education award was
given to Alan Perlis (Yale University) for contributions to education,
especially through his work on programming languages and compiler
construction. Pretty cool that the inaugural Turing Award winner was the
2nd SIGCSE award winner! Wish I could have heard that keynote!

### 1981<a name="#1981"></a>

1981 brought several now-familiar elements to our organization. It was
the first year the Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science
Education award was given out, and it went to William Atchison, the Head
of ACM Curriculum Committee that produced Curriculum \'68, and a
founding leader of University of Maryland Computer Science Department.
Here's the announcement from the Bulletin:

![The Bulletin 1981](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/Bulletin1981.jpg)

In 1981 we elected a new Board: Norman Gibbs (who moved to Arizona State
University) as Chair, Della Bonnette (University of Southwestern
Louisiana) as Vice-Chair, John Frederick Schrage (Southern Illinois
University -- Edwardsville) for Secretary. At-Large members elected were
Robert Aiken (University of Tennessee), Nell Dale (University of Texas
at Austin) and Joyce Currie Little (Community College of Baltimore).

The 12th Technical Symposium was held February 26-27, 1981 in St. Louis,
MO. The Conference Chair was Kenneth Magel (University of Missouri at
Rolla). The Program Chairs were Frank G. Walters (University of Missouri
at Rolla) and Nell Dale (University of Texas at Austin). There were 62
papers submitted with 46 accepted giving a 71.2% acceptance rate.

There were many changes made to the Technical Symposium based on
feedback from the previous ones. This Technical Symposium introduced
some of our now well-known conference features: tutorials, workshops,
Birds of a Feather, and Panel Sessions. These were all explicitly stated
in the call for scholarship.

### 1980<a name="#1980"></a>

On February 14-15, 1980 the 11th Technical Symposium was held in Kansas
City, MO. Bill Bulgren (University of Kansas) served as Conference
Chair. Virgil Wallentine (Kansas City University) was the Program
Chair.\
The Bulletin (Vol. 12, Issue 2, July 1980) reported on the Business
Meeting held during the conference:

![The Bulletin Vol. 12, Issue 2, July
1980](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/BulletinJuly1980.jpg)

The same issue of The Bulletin contains a survey asking questions about
plagiarism in computing classes. Students haven't changed that much...

[↑ Back to top](#Index)

### 1979<a name="#1979"></a>

The 10th Technical Symposium was held Feb 22-23 in Dayton, OH. Doug Kerr
(Ohio State) served as the Conference Chair. John Dalphin (Indiana
University -- Purdue At Fort Wayne) was the Program Chair and 54 papers
were accepted.

We also elected a new Board. Robert Aiken (University of Tennessee) was
re-elected as Chair and Norman Gibbs (College of William and Mary) was
re-elected as Vice-Chair. James Powell (Burroughs Wellcome Company) was
elected as Secretary-Treasurer. All three Director members were
re-elected: Richard Austing (University of Maryland), Gerald Engel
(Christopher Newport College), and Betty Sproule (Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp). Della Bonnette (University of Southwestern Louisiana)
continued as Bulletin Editor (the last of 4 terms) and John Gorgone
(Bentley College) continued as the Assistant Bulletin Editor.

The Bulletin (Volume 11, Issue 3, September 1979) announced the creation
of the SIGCSE Annual Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer
Science Education, and that the recipient would give a keynote at the
Technical Symposium. It took 2 years from announcement to the first
award.

Here's a good one: at the October 31, 1979 Business meeting, the idea of
corporate sponsors was initiated. The proposal was for sponsors to pay
\$200 and receive SIGCSE publications, free attendance at the Technical
Symposium, and have their company listed on the inside cover of the
Bulletin.

### 1978<a name="#1978"></a>

This year was the 10th Anniversary of the founding of SIGCSE. During
1978 we held two conferences, but only one was designated as the
Technical Symposium.

As reported in The Bulletin (Vol. 9, Issue 4, Dec. 1977):

> Ken Williams is organizing what appears to be one of our most
> successful SIGCSE Symposia (scheduled for February 23-24 in Detroit).
> He reports that he has already received a number of interesting papers
> and they\'re still rolling in.

Volume 10, Issue 1, February 1978 contains the papers of the SIGCSE/CSA
technical symposium on computer science education -- but is NOT an
official numbered Technical Symposium. This conference was held in
Detroit, Michigan and chaired by Ken Williams (Western Michigan
University) and had 53 papers accepted with 352 people in attendance. A
full report can be found at <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382187>.

The official 9th Technical Symposium was held August 14-15 in Pittsburgh
and was joint with IEEE/Computer Society Education Committee. Alf
Bertztiss (University of Pittsburgh) was the General Chair.

From The Bulletin (Vol. 10, Issue 2, June 1978):\
![The Bulletin Vol. 10, Issue 2, June
1978](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/ninthTS.jpg)\
Volume 10, Issue 3, August 1978 contains the papers from this
conference. There were over 100 attendees and they came from 25
different states, Canada, Mexico, and Iceland.

You may find it interesting to know the types of events, around the
world, that SIGCSE members were involved in, way back in the late 70s.
In Volume 10, Issue 4, December 1978 of The Bulletin, the following
events were brought to members attention:

-   ACM '78, December where a business meeting was held and SIGCSE
    sponsored several sessions
-   CSC/SIGCSE, the 10th Technical Symposium in February, 1979
-   National Education Computing Conference (NECC), June 1979 in Iowa
    City, billed as a cross-fertilization effort with other
    organizations such as AEDS, ADCIS, and IEEE Computer Society.
-   International Symposium on Computers and Education in Dusseldorf,
    Germany, March, 1979
-   Third World Conference on Computer Education, Lausanne, Switzerland,
    July 1981

Even then we were global! At the December 1978 Business Meeting, there
was a discussion on whether we should be named CSE or CE (computing
education). The name issue is 40 years old!\
(Briana Morrison)

### 1977<a name="#1977"></a>

The 7th Technical Symposium was held February 2-3, 1977 at the Marriott
Hotel in Atlanta, GA jointly with CSC. John Goda from Georgia Institute
of Technology was the Conference Chair. See
<https://portalparts.acm.org/810000/800008/fm/frontmatter.pdf?ip=137.48.185.10>\
for the proceedings. This appears to be the first occurrence of a
workshop (then called Birds of a Feather) on Structured COBOL by Daniel
McCracken, and the first occurrence of a student programming contest at
Georgia Tech.

SIGCSE held another Technical Symposium, the 8th on August 4-5, 1977 at
the University of Southwestern Louisiana Conference Center in Lafayette,
LA. Della Bonnette (from University of Southwestern Louisiana) was the
Conference Chair and Terry Walker, also from University of Southwestern
Louisiana, was the Program Chair. Eighteen papers were accepted for
presentation.

New officers were elected to lead the organization. Robert Aiken served
as Chair with Norman Gibbs as Vice-Chair. Terry Walker was the
Secretary/Treasurer. Board Members were Richard Austing (past chair),
Gerald Engel (past vice-chair), and Betty Sproule (first female board
member!). Della Bonnette continued in her 3rd term as Bulletin Editor
and John Gorgone assisted.

It appears that Betty Sproule has found a successful second career after
CS: <http://stuffcure.com>

There were three special issues of the Bulletin this year: the February
issue contained the proceedings of the 7th Technical Symposium; the June
issue was on computer science curricula; and the July issue contained
the proceedings of the 8th Technical Symposium. From the June issue:\

### 1976<a name="#1976"></a>

From 1976 through 1978, there were actually TWO Technical Symposiums
held each year. The first was held in February, jointly with CSC. The
second, held late mid-year was only a SIGCSE event.

In 1976, the 5th Technical Symposium was held February 12-13 at
Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, CA as part of the ACM Computer Science
Conference. Paul Lorton, Jr. of the University of San Francisco and Ron
Colman from California State University at Fullerton were Conference
Chairs. We don't know how many papers were submitted, but 66 were
accepted. In the Digital Library, this is listed as the "Proceedings of
the SIGCSE-SIGCUE joint symposium on Computer Science Education" (SIGCUE
being Computer Uses in Education), but I can find no corroboration that
this was joint.

Bob Aiken adds this explanation:\

> I remember our Symposia being at least two days with their own General
> Chair and Program Chair (and committee). Some registration numbers
> were difficult to unearth and cost sharing sometimes hard to negotiate
> (though each leadership group tried hard to be equitable). I do
> remember that during that period we set a goal of 1,000 attendees for
> the SIGCSE Symposium ... and it took us a number of years to finally
> reach it (though we were only slightly under that goal for several
> years before achieving it)!

In July of 1976, SIGCSE held its 6th Technical Symposium at Fort
Magruder in Williamsburg, VA -- on our own! Norman Gibbs from the
College of William and Mary was the Conference Chair. Thirty-five papers
were accepted for presentation.\

### 1975<a name="#1975"></a>

The 5th Technical Symposium was held February 20-21, 1975 in Washington,
D.C. The Conference Chair was Gerald Engel from Virginia Institute of
Marine Science. Program chairs were Bruce Barnes (NSF), Norm Gibbs
(College of William and Mary), Susan Gerhart (Duke University), Andrew
Molnar (NSF), Glenn Ingram (NIE), Joyce Little (Community College of
Baltimore), C.K. Capstick (University of Guelph), Harris Burns
(Randolph-Macon College), Richard Austing (University of Maryland), and
Larry John (University of Dayton). There were just over 300 attendees.
Sadly, there seems to be no record of this event in the Digital Library.

In 1975 a new slate of officers was elected. Richard Austing was
re-elected to the Chair Position. Douglas Kerr was the Vice-Chair, and
John Dalphin served as Secretary/Treasurer. Board Members included Barry
Bateman for a second term, Robert Aiken, and Elliott Organick. Della
Bonnette continued as the Bulletin Editor and continued to be assisted
by John Dalphin.\

### 1974<a name="#1974"></a>

In 1974 the 4th Technical Symposium was held in Detroit, MI on February
14-15. Douglas Kerr from The Ohio State University was Conference Chair.
Program Chairs were Toby Berk (Florida International University), Harris
Burns (Randolph-Macon College), Clinton Foulk (Ohio State), Larry John
(University of Dayton), Bruce Klein (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University), and Wayne Tam (Wayne State University). We don't know
how many papers were submitted, but 38 were accepted and there were
approximately 250 attendees. The proceedings from this year within the
Digital Library only seem to include the CSC presentations and no
forward matter exists.

The 4th Technical Symposium was also Frank Friedman's first SIGCSE
conference that he attended, and then he attended for 30 straight years,
minus 1. That's dedication!\

### 1973<a name="#1973"></a>

Starting in 1973 our Technical Symposia were held in conjunction with
the "Computer Science Conference." This conference focused more on
research and primarily consisted of a few invited speakers and numerous
short abstracts of ongoing Computer Science research activities.
Providing a forum for PhD candidates to discuss their work and for
departments to recruit was also a primary function! Originally it was
sponsored by some large Universities and corporations. ACM handled many
of the organizing details.

The 3rd Technical Symposium was held February 22-23, 1973 at The Ohio
State University in Columbus, OH, in conjunction with the Computer
Science Conference (CSC). Gerald Engel from Pennsylvania State
University was the Conference Chair. "Over 80" papers were submitted
with 43 of them accepted for presentation. Check out
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1125118> for a look at the programs.
Here's the conference committee:\
![The 1973 conference
committee](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/thirdTS.png)

However, since the Technical Symposium was held jointly with CSC, exact
attendance numbers are difficult to ascertain. It was the primarily
those associated with the CSC that handled most of the finances,
registration, etc. (though we had a reasonably straightforward agreement
as to how our registration would be handled, finances and expenses
determined\--mostly from exhibits and registrations). This resulted in
SIGCSE not having total control over the exact "numbers." For example,
one day and late registrations were sometime difficult to ascertain.
However, we do have a few estimates. For our meeting in Columbus in 1973
we had about 200 attendees.

We have two pictures from this conference:\

Taulbee.](/assets/images/50yearsofSIGCSE/TaulbeeYovits.jpg)\

Taulbee did the Taulbee Report. Yovits probably chaired the very first
CSC.

for the picture).

Some were ACM officers, including Gwen Bell. According to Frank: "Most
of the CSC Committee were women and they were REALLY GOOD people. They
basically ran the show."

A new Board was also elected. Chair was Richard Austing. Vice-Chair was
Gerald Engel. Secretary/Treasurer was J. Robert Jump. Board Members were
Barry Bateman, Aaron Finerman (past chair), and Seymour Pollock (past
Symposium chair). Della Bonnette became the Bulletin Editor and was
assisted by John Dalphin. A quick internet search says that Della
Bonnette is still active with CSAB and accreditation issues.

My sincere gratitude to Bob Aiken for helping me dig up some of this
information.\

### 1972<a name="#1972"></a>

The 2nd Technical Symposium was held at Washington University in St.
Louis on March 24-25, 1972. The Conference Chair was Seymour V. Pollack
from Washington University in St. Louis. The Program Chair was Leland
Williams from Triangle Universities Computation Center and Robert Aiken
(University of Tennessee) once again was Editor of the Proceedings.
Again, "over 40" papers were submitted with approximately 30 being
accepted. There were 179 attendees. (Briana Morrison)

Also, some additional information from Chris Wilcox about the man who
organized SIGCSE and was the first Chair:\
Dr. Organick was my master\'s thesis advisor and a personal friend of
our family. I first met him by chance in the 1970\'s at a remote lake in
the Uinta mountains where my father and I were backpacking. He was
diagnosed with leukemia shortly afterward, and told that he had a very
short time to live, however he actually survived for another ten years.
During that period he became my advisor and I learned from him as well
as teaching for him numerous times during his illness. I credit him with
sending me down the path of becoming a computer science professor. He
was a man of complete integrity and boundless energy, both before and
after his diagnosis. I still remember him telling me with his usual
prescience how excited he was about object-oriented programming (in
Ada), and how that would be the next big thing, I think anyone that knew
him would give the same sort of testimonial, and I was not in the least
surprised that he was a charter member of the SIGCSE organization.

### 1971<a name="#1971"></a>

There was no Technical Symposium held during 1971, instead it was moved
to the early months of the following year (February/March) which has
been fairly constant since that time. SIGCSE did get a new slate of
officers in 1971: Aaron Finerman was Chair, Tom Kurtz was Vice-Chair,
and David Matula continued as Secretary/Treasurer. Board members
included Robert Aiken, Peter Denning, and Richard Hamming. Robert Aiken
continued to serve as the Bulletin Editor. (Briana Morrison)

### 1970<a name="#1970"></a>

In 1970 SIGCSE Board Members were Elliott Organick, Chair; David Matula,
Secretary/Treasurer; and Robert Aiken was the Bulletin Editor.

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium was the first conference organized by our
newly founded SIG. The first Technical Symposium was held on the 16th of
November, 1970 in Houston, TX. Peter Calingaert from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill was the Conference Chair. Edward A.
Feustel from Rice University was in charge of Arrangements and Publicity
and Robert Aiken from the University of Tennessee was the Program Chair
and Editor of the Proceedings. There were 143 attendees. There were
"over 40" papers submitted with 18 accepted. :

The program was divided into three main sections:\
1) morning session looked at computer science in a global sense\
2) afternoon session looked at courses generally, and\
3) the evening session considered the first course in computer science

In addition, the question of establishing a Journal of Computer Science
Education was brought up and the consensus of the group was that the
SIGCSE Bulletin was meeting the current need.

The December 1970 issue of the Bulletin (
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873668>) lists the 600+ members of
the organization! It also contained the announcement of the first
student paper competition.\

### 1969<a name="#1969"></a>

Beginning in 1969 Elliot Organick served as the founding chair of SIGCSE
with Bob Aiken the founding secretary/treasurer and TW Hildebrandt the
founding editor of the Bulletin. The first Steering Group (the original
Board) consisted of Jack Belzer, Peter Calingaert, TW Hildebradt, Thomas
Keenan, Earl Schweppe, and William Viavant. William Atchison and S.D.
Conte served as Ex-Officio members of the Steering Group. (Briana
Morrison)

The FIRST SIGCSE Bulletin was published in February, 1969 (
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873609>) and was 22 typed pages! It
included information about the organizing committee of the newly formed
SIG and a call for a move toward a journal on computer science education
(what foresight!). There is also a wonderful article on a survey sent to
the SIGCSE members on their ranking of problem/discussion areas.

The second Bulletin was published in June, 1969 (
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873611>) followed by additional
editions in October ( <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873615>) and
December ( <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873618>). The October
issued noted that there were more than 350 members. We have had 4 or 5
issues of the Bulletin every year since.

### 1968<a name="#1968"></a>

The year is 1968. A group of computing educators met at the Fall Joint
Computer Conference (FJCC) in Las Vegas to write and sign a petition
that eventually led to the creation of SIGCSE. Elliot Irving Organick
(1925 -- 1985) is credited with being the driving force behind the
group. The petition was signed by 20 ACM members, including Bob Aiken.
