*Note: "SIGCSE Global" was a temporary name for this conference. The conference has now been named ACM Global Computing Education Conference, with a short name of CompEd.*

The ACM Global Computing Education Conference (CompEd) is SIGCSE's new, fourth conference. There will be three conferences, being held every other year before a review. The first CompEd was held in Chengdu, China on May 17-19 2019. In general, the conference should run in countries where we do not regularly hold SIGCSE conferences, so not in North America or Europe.

The 2019 website is [here.](http://www.acmcomped.org/)

We are considering a site in India for the second CompEd in 2021. There is some flexibility on holding the conference at different times of the year, as long as it is not too close to one of our other conferences. The language of the conference will be English.

Please respond by March 2, 2020, though we will continue to look at responses after that date if required.

**Proposing an ACM Global Computing Education Conference Location**

CompEd will be hosted by universities whose computing faculty are committed to the improvement of computing education. SIGCSE seeks proposals from universities interested in hosting CompEd. The conference takes place any time during the year, but at least 6 weeks away from one of SIGCSE's other conference. [More information](https://www.acmcomped.org/host/).
