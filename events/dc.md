Since 1998, SIGCSE has sponsored a Doctoral Consortium (DC) with three
main goals:

-   To offer a friendly forum for students to discuss their work and
    receive constructive feedback.
-   To offer relevant information on issues important to doctoral
    candidates.
-   To nurture a community of researchers.

The DC is designed primarily for Ph.D students in computing-related
areas who are planning a career in academia. Students whose research
focus is related to computing education are a primary focus, although
doctoral students in any computing-related area are welcome to apply.
