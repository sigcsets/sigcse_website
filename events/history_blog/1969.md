Beginning in 1969 Elliot Organick served as the founding chair of SIGCSE
with Bob Aiken the founding secretary/treasurer and TW Hildebrandt the
founding editor of the Bulletin. The first Steering Group (the original
Board) consisted of Jack Belzer, Peter Calingaert, TW Hildebradt, Thomas
Keenan, Earl Schweppe, and William Viavant. William Atchison and S.D.
Conte served as Ex-Officio members of the Steering Group. (Briana

The FIRST SIGCSE Bulletin was published in February, 1969 (
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873609>) and was 22 typed pages! It
included information about the organizing committee of the newly formed
SIG and a call for a move toward a journal on computer science education
(what foresight!). There is also a wonderful article on a survey sent to
the SIGCSE members on their ranking of problem/discussion areas.

The second Bulletin was published in June, 1969 (
<https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873611>) followed by additional
editions in October ( <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873615>) and
December ( <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=873618>). The October
issued noted that there were more than 350 members. We have had 4 or 5
issues of the Bulletin every year since.
