In 1970 SIGCSE Board Members were Elliott Organick, Chair; David Matula,
Secretary/Treasurer; and Robert Aiken was the Bulletin Editor.

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium was the first conference organized by our
newly founded SIG. The first Technical Symposium was held on the 16th of
November, 1970 in Houston, TX. Peter Calingaert from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill was the Conference Chair. Edward A.
Feustel from Rice University was in charge of Arrangements and Publicity
and Robert Aiken from the University of Tennessee was the Program Chair
and Editor of the Proceedings. There were 143 attendees. There were
"over 40" papers submitted with 18 accepted. :

The program was divided into three main sections:\
1) morning session looked at computer science in a global sense\
2) afternoon session looked at courses generally, and\
3) the evening session considered the first course in computer science

In addition, the question of establishing a Journal of Computer Science
Education was brought up and the consensus of the group was that the
SIGCSE Bulletin was meeting the current need.

The December 1970 issue of the Bulletin (

the organization! It also contained the announcement of the first
student paper competition.\
