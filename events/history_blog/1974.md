In 1974 the 4th Technical Symposium was held in Detroit, MI on February
14-15. Douglas Kerr from The Ohio State University was Conference Chair.
Program Chairs were Toby Berk (Florida International University), Harris
Burns (Randolph-Macon College), Clinton Foulk (Ohio State), Larry John
(University of Dayton), Bruce Klein (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University), and Wayne Tam (Wayne State University). We don't know
how many papers were submitted, but 38 were accepted and there were
approximately 250 attendees. The proceedings from this year within the
Digital Library only seem to include the CSC presentations and no
forward matter exists.

The 4th Technical Symposium was also Frank Friedman's first SIGCSE
conference that he attended, and then he attended for 30 straight years,
minus 1. That's dedication!\
