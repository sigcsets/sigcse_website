From Volume 41, Issue 2, June 2009 Inroads: SIGCSE unveiled its new
website design ([http://sigcse.org](../index.html)) in early April. Our
webmaster, Scott Grissom at Grand Valley State worked long and hard on
this transition.

The SIGCSE Board meets face-to-face twice a year (once at the Symposium)
and has begun almost monthly conference phone meetings. You can keep
abreast of our decision makings and deliberations, again by consulting
the website section at [http://sigcse.org/about](../../about.html)

The Volume 41, Issue 4, December 2009 was the last issue of Inroads as a
newsletter. Officially it was:

Welcome to this final edition of inroads -- the SIGCSE Bulletin. This
Volume 41, Number 4, 2009 December, issue represents the last time that
inroads (with lower case "i") will be synonymous with the SIGCSE
Bulletin. Starting in 2010, the SIGCSE Bulletin will continue with
Volume 42, Number 1 as an online newsletter. The "new" SIGCSE Bulletin
would contain news items related to SIGCSE and its operations as well as
other SIGCSE-related information. Starting in 2010, in addition to the
SIGCSE Bulletin, ACM will publish Volume 1, Number 1 of a magazine
called ACM Inroads (with upper case "I"). This new ACM magazine will
have content similar to inroads as found in this current 2009 December
issue. Columnists will continue to contribute to the publication;
invited editorials would continue to appear when appropriate.
