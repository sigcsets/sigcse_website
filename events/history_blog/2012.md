The 43rd Technical Symposium was held February 29-March 3, 2012 in
Raleigh, North Carolina. The Conference Co-Chairs were Laurie Smith King
(College of the Holy Cross) and Dave Musicant (Carleton College). The
Program Co-Chairs were Tracy Camp (Colorado School of Mines) and Paul
Tymann (Rochester Institute of Technology). There were 291 papers
submitted with 100 accepted (34% acceptance rate). There were 1286
attendees.

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to Harold (Hal) Abelson for improving not only the way we teach
computing by his contributions to Logo, App Inventor, and his textbook
authorship but also the way we view knowledge in the broader society,
through his leadership with the Free Software and Open Educational
Resources movements and his founding efforts with the Creative Commons
initiative.

The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to Jane
Prey for her love of and dedication to the computing education community
\-- academic, industry, government and professional societies; and for
her tireless efforts in encouraging more students, especially women, to
pursue education and careers in computing.

The 17th ITiCSE conference was held July 3-5, 2012 in Haifa, Israel -
the first trip for the conference outside of Europe. The Conference
Co-Chairs were Tami Lapidot (Technion Israel) and Judith Gal-Ezer, (The
Open University). The Program Co-Chairs were Michael Caspersen (Aarhus
University) and Bruce Klein (Grand Valley State University). There were
134 papers submitted with 60 accepted for a 45% acceptance rate. There
were 188 people in attendance and 4 working groups.

All three Keynotes of ITiCSE 2012 were in conjunction with the Turing
Centenary events of the Alan Turing Year. Turing award winner Prof.
Michael Rabin, Hebrew University and Harvard University, talked about
his vision of high school Computer Science Education; Prof. Lenore Blum,
Carnegie Mellon University, talked about \"Alan Turing and the Other
Theory of Computation\" and highlighted Turing\'s work related to the
foundations of numerical computation; Prof. David Harel, Weizmann
Institute of Science, presented Turing's major achievements in three
different fields: computability, biological modeling and artificial
intelligence, and explained how each of them motivated and inspired his
own research interests. The conference program included 60 papers, 3
invited panels, 13 tips, techniques & courseware presentations, and 23
posters. (The Bulletin, Vol. 44, No. 3, July 2012).

The 8th ICER conference was held September 10-12, 2012 at Auckland
University of Technology in Auckland, New Zealand. In charge of all the
local arrangements was Alison Young (Christchurch Polytecnic Institute
of Technology). The Conference and Program Co-Chairs were Alison Young
(Christchurch Polytecnic Institute of Technology), Kate Sanders (Rhode
Island College), and Beth Simon (University of California at San Diego).
There were 53 papers submitted. There were 15 research papers and 8
discussion papers accepted (39% acceptance rate). There were also nine
lightning talks for the 61 registered attendees. The keynote speaker was
Professor Jan Meyer from the University of Queensland, Australia, who
spoke eloquently about "Threshold Concepts, Pedagogy and Student
Learning: Challenges and Opportunities" and related this theory to
computing.\
