The theme of the symposium was \"The Changing Face of Computing\". For
the first time at SIGCSE, there was a movie shown following the Thursday
night reception, \"CODEBREAKER\"
([www.turingfilm.com](http://www.turingfilm.com)). The movie describes
the remarkable and tragic story of Alan Turing, one of the 20th
century\'s most important people. The Executive Producer of this
drama-documentary participated in a Q&A session following the movie. A
very popular feature of recent Technical Symposiums, the \"puzzle
extravaganza\" started this year.
