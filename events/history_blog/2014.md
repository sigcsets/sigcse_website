The 45th Technical Symposium was held March 5-8, 2014 in Atlanta,
Georgia. The Conference Co-Chairs were J. D. Dougherty (Haverford
College) and Kris Nagel (Georgia Gwinnett College). The Program
Co-Chairs were Adrienne Decker (Rochester Institute of Technology) and
Kurt Eiselt (University of British Columbia). There were 274 papers
submitted with 100 accepted (39.4% acceptance rate). There is some
discrepancy on the number of attendees, with the registration team
reporting 1383 and the website
([https://sigcse.org/sigcse/events/symposia/2014/](symposia/2014/index.html))
reporting 1285. Clarification anyone?

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to Robert Panoff for promoting student enrichment, curriculum
development, faculty enhancement, and infusing computational thinking at
all levels through Shodor and the National Computational Science
Institute.

The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to Andrea
Lawrence for dedication to the computing education community, serving as
a role model and mentor to students and faculty, improving diversity in
computing education, making computing education available to everyone,
and for helping students and faculty to \"Find a way or make one\". You
can listen to an interview with Andrea through the Computing Educators
Oral History Project here:

The very first New Educators Workshop was held in conjunction with the
Technical Symposium on March 5, 2014 and was led by David Reed
(Creighton University) and Andrea Danyluk (Williams College). The SIGCSE
Board agreed to run this workshop every other year. This meant that the
Department Chair Roundtable and the New Educators Workshop would
alternate every year at SIGCSE.

And now for a very special group - the SIGCSE CSEngers!!! The marvelous
Jesse Heines (University of Massachusetts, Lowell) organized volunteers
each year who practiced and then performed at the closing luncheon. It
was a guaranteed good time!\

This ICER will forever be known as the \"dancing\" ICER as the
participants enjoyed a Scottish ceilidh dance following the conference
banquet. Much of the night\'s festivities were captured by the Google
Glasses worn by several of the students in attendance.\
