We are up to 2017 and the 48th Technical Symposium was held March 8-11
in Seattle, Washington. The Conference Chairs were Michael E. Caspersen
(Aarhus University) and Stephen Edwards (Virginia Tech). The Program
Chairs were Tiffany Barnes (North Carolina State University) and Dan
Garcia (University of California Berkeley). The SIGCSE 2017 conference
theme---Inspire, Innovate, Improve!---highlights our aim to inspire
computing educators to innovate new teaching strategies, and to improve
those strategies by engaging in the self-reflection and evaluation
necessary to deliver the best possible learning outcomes for all. This
year we recognizedf a new category of the top 25% of accepted papers as
"Exemplary papers", highlighted by the Program Chairs for their
accomplishment of high quality, novelty and broad appeal to reviewers.
The Program Chairs also selected three best papers, that each received
at least 2 of the highest rankings from reviewers. The Best CS Education
Research Paper is "Computing with CORGIS: Diverse, Real-world Datasets
for Introductory Computing" by Austin Bart, Ryan Whitcomb, Dennis
Kafura, Cliff Shaffer and Eli Tilevich. The Best New Program Paper is
"Infrastructure for Continuous Assessment of Retained Relevant
Knowledge" by Kathleen Timmerman and Travis Doom. The Best Experience
Report Paper is "Making Noise: Using Sound-Art to Explore Technological
Fluency" by Erik Brunvand and Nina McCurdy. There were 348 paper
submitted and 105 were accepted (30% acceptance rate). There were 1414
attendees! Here are the full submission statistics:\

The Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education Award was
given to Gail Chapman for long term impact on computer science education
through the creation of curriculum, teacher professional development,
and fierce advocacy for social equity in all computing classrooms.

The Lifetime Service to Computer Science Education was awarded to Mats
Daniels for more than two decades of dedicated service to computing
education research, building and supporting the international network of
computing educators. You can listen to an interview with Mats through

The 22nd ITiCSE conference was held in Bologna, Italy on July 3-5, 2017.
The Conference Co-Chairs were Renzo Davoli (University of Bologna) and
Michael Goldweber (Xavier University). The Program Co-Chairs were Guido
Rößling (Technische Universität Darmstadt) and Irene Polycarpou
(University of Central Lancashire). The conference continues to be a
truly international conference with 241 submissions with a total of 554
authors from 40 countries on all continents: the authors came from
Africa (5), Asia (33), Europe (232), the Middle East (11), North America
including Central America and the Caribbean (189), Oceania (34), and
South America (50). A total of 175 papers, one panel, 31 posters, 18
tips & techniques and 16 working groups were submitted. This year, 56
papers (32%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the
proceedings along with 24 posters, 9 Tips and Techniques and 9 accepted
working groups. There were 228 attendees.

The 11th ICER conference was held August 18-20, 2017 in Tacoma,
Washington. The General Chairs were Josh Tenenberg and Donald Chinn
(both from University of Washington Tacoma), Judy Sheard (Monash
University), and Lauri Malmi (Aalto University). The Program Chairs were
Josh Tenenberg (University of Washington Tacoma) and Lauri Malmi (Aalto
University). The Associate Chair (Junior Site Chair) was Ari Korhonen
(Aalto University). There were a record 180 submissions with 29 papers
accepted for a 16% acceptance rate! There was a record 157 attendees!

One thing I\'ve neglected to mention about the ICER conference is the
Works In Progress Workshop co-located with ICER. This was started in
2014 as the Critical Research Review and was chaired by Colleen Lewis
(Harvey Mudd College). Somewhat like a Doctoral Consortium for faculty,
it has been held every year since and is now a permanent part of the
ICER program.

The 21st Doctoral Consortium was co-located with ICER and held on August
17, 2017. Leading the efforts were Ben Shapiro (University of Colorado,
Boulder) and Jan Vahrenhold (University of Münster). There were 20
participants.
