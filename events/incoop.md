ACM SIGCSE may give in-cooperation status to non-SIGCSE events that are
fully sponsored by other non-profit organizations. To approved, the
event(s) must be relevant to SIGCSE and provide some sort of benefit to
SIGCSE members. For further details see the
[in-cooperation](../policies/incooperation.html) policy.

Future and recent in-cooperation events:

{% assign items = site.data.incoop | sort: 'year' | reverse %}
