A Working Group comprises a team of typically 5 to 10 researchers who
work together on a project related to computing education. Working
Groups are a special feature of ITiCSE and have been part of the
conference since its beginning in 1996. In 2019 Working Groups will also
convene at the inaugural CompEd conference.

Working Groups provide a wonderful opportunity to work intensively on a
topic of interest with an international group of computing education
researchers. Working groups begin work electronically for several months
before convening for face-to-face work at the conference. At the end of
the face-to-face meeting the groups submit a draft report that is
refined over the following few weeks. The reports are reviewed and, if
accepted, published in the ACM digital library.

Signing up to a Working Group is a commitment to hard work ... but
rewarding and unforgettable experiences. Working Group reports are some
of the most cited computing education publications in the ACM Digital
Library.
