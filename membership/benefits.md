Membership in SIGCSE supports the following programs:

-   SIGCSE conferences, which are currently the SIGCSE Technical
    Symposium, the Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer
    Science Education (ITiCSE), and the International Computing
    Education Research (ICER) workshop.
-   Special Projects awards, which support researchers who wish to
    investigate and introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of
    computing.
-   Speaker's Fund, which supports the dissemination of outstanding
    SIGCSE Symposium, ITiCSE, or ICER presentations to in-cooperation
    conferences and benefits computing educators broadly.
-   Travel Grant Program, which supports attendance at the SIGCSE
    Symposium for first-time faculty and teachers by providing
    reimbursement for travel.
-   SIGCSE awards (Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science
    Education and Lifetime Service to the Computer Science Education
    Community) which honor individuals or groups who have made lasting
    contributions to the computing education community.
-   The annual Doctoral Consortium in which Ph.D. students discuss their
    work, receive constructive feedback, and are mentored on important
    issues with the goal of nurturing the next generation of computing
    education researchers. SIGCSE provides travel support for attendees
    and organizers of the consortium.
-   The biennial New Educator's Workshop which is typically held in
    conjunction with the SIGCSE Symposium and provides information
    important to computing educators who are new to academia or who will
    seek an academic position in the near future. SIGCSE provides travel
    support for attendees and organizers of the workshop.
-   The biennial Chairs' Workshop which is typically held in conjunction
    with the SIGCSE Symposium and provides a forum for discussing and
    disseminating information relevant to academics who chair computing
    departments or hold other academic positions. SIGCSE provides
    support for organizers of the workshop.
-   Kids' Camp held at the SIGCSE Symposium which provides activities
    and meals for children of attendees.

Membership in SIGCSE provides the following direct benefits:

-   Four issues of ACM Inroads including peer reviewed articles, columns

    conferences (SIGCSE Symposium, ITiCSE including the formally
    reviewed reports of the working groups, and ICER).
-   Four issues of the SIGCSE Bulletin, which are available
    electronically.
-   Reduced registration rates for the SIGCSE Symposium, ITiCSE, and
    ICER.
-   Free access to SIGCSE publication archives through the ACM Digital
    Library.

    professionals.
