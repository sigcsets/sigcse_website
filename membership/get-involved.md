SIGCSE's successes depend primarily on the insight, energy, and
commitment of its members. The following listing suggests several ways
that SIGCSE members can participate in various activities of the
organization.

Some more information about volunteering for SIGCSE can be found in this
[presentation]({{"/files/documents/pdfs/How%20to%20Volunteer%20with%20SIGCSE%202019.pdf" | absolute_url}}).

**Attending conferences:** SIGCSE sponsors four computing education
conferences, three held annually and one biennially:

-   The annual SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education
    is held in February or March in the United States.
-   The annual Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education
    conference (ITiCSE) is usually held in June or July in Europe.
-   The annual International Computing Education Research (ICER)
    Conference aims at gathering high-quality contributions to the
    computing education research discipline. It is held at sites in
    North America, Europe, and Australasia.
-   The biennial ACM Global Computing Education Conference will be held
    for the first time in 2019. This will be held in sites other than
    North America, Europe, and Australasia.

**Reviewing papers and other submissions for conferences:** Papers,
panels, and other submissions to SIGCSE conferences undergo an extensive
reviewing process.

-   SIGCSE members are usually invited to volunteer to review for the
    Technical Symposium each year through an on-line form before
    reviewing commences. The home pages of the conferences have more
    details.

**Participating on and/or starting a SIGCSE Committee:** SIGCSE\'s
Committee Initiative encourages all SIGCSE members to participate in
substantive discussions on areas of community interest, with the goals
of investigating topics in depth and culminating with substantive
reports.\
For more information, see [SIGCSE Committees]({{"/programs/committees/index.html" | absolute_url}})

**Creating/Joining a local SIGCSE Chapter:** Local or regional
associations provide a mechanism for collaboration and cooperation
within your locale. A SIGCSE Chapter can provide a structure to
facilitate this exchange. For more information, see [SIGCSE Local Chapters]({{"/programs/local-chapters/index.html" | absolute_url}})

**Submitting a Special Project Grant Proposal:** SIGCSE now funds a
limited number of Special Projects to help its members investigate and
introduce new ideas in the learning and teaching of computing. The
maximum funding is \$5,000 USD per proposal and the level of funding is
subject to the quality of proposals received and the availability of
funds targeted for such projects. For previous award winners and
instructions for how to apply, see [SIGCSE Special Projects]({{"/programs/special/index.html" | absolute_url}}).

**Working on a Symposium or Conference Committee:** SIGCSE conferences
happen because volunteers handle numerous responsibilities and details.

-   Some common tasks: conference co-chair, program co-chair, panels,
    special sessions, workshops, posters, birds-of-a-feather,
    proceedings, treasurer, registration, local arrangements, student
    volunteers/activities, evaluation, roommate matching, database
    administration, tips and techniques, demonstrations, etc.
-   Your SIGCSE Board selects experienced leaders as conference and
    program co-chairs. All other positions are selected by those
    co-chairs on the basis of known willingness to serve. Typically,
    committee membership includes a mix of experienced and new people.
-   More information about volunteer positions is available
    [here]({{"/about/volunteers.html" | absolute_url}}).

**Share ideas on the SIGCSE listservs:**

    of interest to all SIGCSE members. This list is fully moderated and
    has extremely low traffic (approximately one message per month).
    Browse or search the [sigcse-announce
    archive](http://listserv.acm.org/archives/sigcse-announce.html) for
    previous postings.
-   <SIGCSE.MEMBERS@acm.org> is fully moderated and has moderate traffic
    (averages one or two per day). Browse or search the [sigcse-members
