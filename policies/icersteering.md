---

**Membership (5 voting members in total)**

- 4 general members

    * One member from each of the geographic areas ICER is held in (North America, Europe, Australasia)
    * At least one of the members must have been a prior ICER program chair (or equivalent under original chair system)
    * At least one of the members must have been a prior ICER site chair (or equivalent under original chair system)

- Current SIGCSE Board Liaison to ICER (SIGCSE Board Member)

**Terms of service**

* The general members of the Steering Committee serve a term of three years, with a maximum of two terms. Terms should be offset so that the two general members do not rotate off of the committee at the same time. Initial terms may need to be adjusted to accommodate this requirement. Please see the end of this document for initial membership terms. Terms will begin and end with an ICER conference. Term will commence at the ICER conference of the starting year and end at the ICER conference of the ending year.

* Members can be reappointed to the committee after a period of 2 years of not being on the committee.

**Roles within the steering committee:**

* Chair &mdash; to be chosen by the committee after each ICER conference and communicated by September 1 to the SIGCSE Board. The ICER Steering Committee chair cannot be the SIGCSE Board liaison.

* Secretary &mdash; to be chosen by the committee after each ICER conference and communicated by September 1 to the SIGCSE Board. The ICER Steering Committee secretary cannot be the SIGCSE Board member. All minutes of ICER Steering Committee meetings (after approval) should be sent to the SIGCSE Board.

* Site inspection &mdash; A critical task will be identifying future sites for ICER. At least one member of the committee (not the SIGCSE Board member) should be designated as lead for this task.

**The Role of the Steering Committee is:**

1. To define the scope of content of the conference.

2. To approve the format of the conference. This includes the length of the conference, types of sessions, and possible related activities.

3. To ensure consistent, high quality conference content, for example by setting guidelines for the review process and minimum standards for acceptance of content.

4. To monitor the quality of conference content and the conference experience for attendees, and make adjustments where necessary.

5. To select the location and dates of future conferences. It is expected that the Steering Committee will solicit proposals from interested parties and upon collecting nominations, select a future location to propose to the SIGCSE board for approval. Typically sites should be identified at least 2 years in advance of the conference. (With the goal of this being done 3 years in advance in the near future.)

6.  To conduct an open call for program chairs, site chairs and other related event chairs.

7.  To select other central and recurring roles on the organising committee, including the submission/database coordinator, Works in Progress Workshop leads, and other roles needed for the successful running of the conference.

8.  To collaborate with and support conference committees. This includes guidance for the organisation and program of the conference, and putting in place mechanisms to accumulate and transfer experience between conferences.

9.  To propose significant changes to the structure of the conference or steering committee to the SIGCSE board.

10. To coordinate with current Program Chairs and General Chairs to ensure the current offering of ICER adheres to SIGCSE Board policies and guidelines from the Steering Committee.

**Working**

The Steering Committee should meet as needed, typically at least three times a year via phone/teleconference and once a year face to face at the ICER conference. More teleconference meetings are encouraged, especially within these first few years to ensure that items are moving forward in appropriate timelines.

The agenda and minutes of the Steering Committee meetings are circulated to committee members, and to the SIGCSE Board.

**Expenses and Expectations**

Steering committee members are expected to attend the conference at their own expense (travel and accommodation). In recognition of the work they put into the conference, they will be given discounted registration.
