##### Terms of service

Each member of the Steering Committee serves a term of three years, with a maximum of two terms. Terms should be offset so that at least one person and not more than two are finishing at the same time. In order to accomplish this, some initial terms may be adjusted.
The Role of the Steering Committee is:
1. To steer ITiCSE as an annual International Computing Education Conference in Europe.
2. To define the scope of content of the conference. This should at least include content:
	* relevant to computing education in higher education and at school level
	* for researchers and practitioners at all educational levels.
3. To define the format of the conference. This includes the length of the conference, types of sessions, and possible related activities.
4. To ensure consistent, high quality conference content, for example by setting guidelines for the review process and minimum standards for acceptance of content.
5. To monitor the quality of conference content and the conference experience for attendees, and make adjustments where necessary.
6. To conduct an open call for program co-chairs, conference hosts and working group chair. At present the location determines one of the conference co-chairs (the conference host).
7. To select the location and dates of future conferences. It is expected that selected members (typically two) visit candidate sites and report back to the Steering Committee, who then select a future location to propose to the SIGCSE board for approval. Typically site visits should be identified and conducted 3 years in advance of the conference.
8. To select and present for approval to the SIGCSE board, one of the program co-chairs and the working group chair.
9. To select other central and recurring roles on the organising committee, including the second conference co-chair, second program chair, treasurer, registration, submission system, proceedings, web, supporter/exhibitor, database, etc.
10. To collaborate with and support conference committees. This includes guidance for the organisation and program of the conference, and putting in place mechanisms to accumulate and transfer experience between conferences.
11. To present to the SIGCSE Board any changes to the structure of the organising committee.

##### Working

The Steering Committee should meet as needed, typically at least three times a year via phone/teleconference and once a year face to face at the ITiCSE conference​.
The agenda and minutes of the Steering Committee meetings are circulated to committee members, and to the ACM SIGCSE, ACM Europe and Informatics Europe boards.

##### Expenses and Expectations

Steering committee members are expected to attend the conference at their own expense (travel and accommodation). In recognition of the work they put into the conference, they will be given discounted registration. Expenses for site visits will be covered by SIGCSE. The steering committee is encouraged to minimize these costs by sending Europeans to do these visits and avoiding intercontinental travel where possible.
