**\*\*\* Please note this policy is currently under review for ICER and
CompEd \*\*\***

Approved by the SIGCSE Board: May 1, 2009\
Updated: January 14, 2019

This policy applies to remuneration for conference committee members. A
separate policy for remuneration for the SIGCSE board and its
representatives is stated elsewhere.

<h5>General Statements</h5>

-   This document contains guidelines provided by the SIGCSE Board to be
    used by conference committee chairs when planning conference related
    travel reimbursement and waived registrations. The intent of this
    document is to help the chairs, not to hinder them. Since every
    conference has its own particular \"situation\", it may be
    useful/beneficial/necessary for committee chairs to stray from these
    guidelines in some cases. In situations where the desired approach
    differs significantly from these guidelines, it is best if the
    chairs get permission from the Board ahead of time.
-   We strongly suggest that conference chairs make clear, to all
    volunteers, what level of support they can expect. This should
    happen as early as possible.
-   Remuneration for conference committee members should be somewhat
    proportional to the amount of work required by the committee
    members.
-   Full compensation for all attendees for pre-conference planning
    meetings is usually provided. That said, it is suggested that
    attendance at such meetings be restricted to those committee members
    whose presence is indispensible.
-   Full compensation for all invited speakers and award winners is
    usually provided, however it is typically limited to the number of
    days required for them to attend the conference for purposes of
    giving their talk and/or receiving their award.
-   Remuneration is partially tied to the budget constraints of each
    conference. The conference budget should include the projected cost
    of reimbursed travel expenses for committee members. People
    receiving waived registration should be included in the projected
    attendance numbers, and therefore reflected in projected expenses
    per attendee. Of course, since their registration fee is being
    waived, no income from their registration should be included in the
    budget.
-   Considering the high cost of international travel, care must be
    taken when putting together conference committees. On the one hand
    we do want to promote broad participation. On the other hand we must
    be fiscally responsible. In some cases it may be necessary when
    inviting participation from distant places to agree to a \"ceiling\"
    amount of travel coverage, rather than a percent of the cost.

<h5>SIGCSE Technical Symposium</h5>

-   Typically, all committee members receive free registration. However,
    depending on circumstances it may be necessary at times for the
    chairs to require some committee members to pay full or half
    registration.
-   Conference Chair(s) and Program Chairs(s) should have all expenses
    covered.
-   For a \"significant contribution,\" up to full expenses will be paid
    for other committee members (at the discretion of the Chair).

<h5>ITiCSE Conference</h5>
-   Registration is waived for Conference Chairs, Program Chairs, Working
Group chairs, and Registrar. For any of the above roles where the person
is not local, travel expenses and accommodations are covered.\
The Database Coordinator, Website Coordinator and Proceedings Chair are
given complimentary registration.

<h5>ICER Workshop</h5>

-   Typically, registration is waived, and all expenses are covered, for
    the two visiting program chairs. Registration for the local chair is
    waived.
