_Approved by the SIGCSE Board: May 30, 2017_\
_Revised: August 14, 2017_

##### Structure of SIGCSE Site Visit committee and rotation of positions

-   The SIGCSE Site Visit committee comprises a chair, junior chair and
    a pool of site visitors.
-   The chair of the SIGCSE Site Visit committee serves a 2 year term.
    The SIGCSE Board approves the chair.
    -   The chair is responsible for asking the outgoing symposium
        chairs if they are interested in joining the pool of site
        visitors for the following year. (E.g. SIGCSE 20xx chair would
        start on committee in 20xx+1) Pending approval from the SIGCSE
        Board, the outgoing chairs will join the pool.
    -   The chair may identify and recommend additional members for the
        pool by submitting their names and qualifications to the SIGCSE
        Board. Upon Board approval, those members will join the pool.
    -   The chair maintains the current list of the members of the pool
        and in the first year of their term, identifies the next chair
        from the pool to be approved by the Board. The goal is that the
        new junior chair will start serving as soon as possible during
        the chair's term.
    -   The chair/junior chair maintain site visit documentation as
        described below in documentation section.
    -   After their term, the chair can choose to go back to the pool
        (pending Board approval), but cannot be chosen by his/her junior
        chair to be chair again, i.e. must sit out a cycle and if chosen
        again, must once again be Board approved.
    -   The chair is responsible for managing the relationship with the
        ACM and communicating with them to arrange RFPs and site visits.
        The ACM negotiates and approves contracts. It is important that
        the chair be aware of the timeline for the site visits and
        recommendations to the board.
-   There is a junior chair who serves for 2 years overlapping the chair
    and then serves as chair for 2 years, so effectively a 4-year
    appointment. This is a Board approved position.
    -   The junior chair is in charge of determining if current members
        of the pool would like to rotate off at the end of the year.
    -   During the junior chair's tenure, it will be important for them
        to learn about the communication process with the ACM and the
        timelines expected by the board. The job of the junior chair
        primarily is to learn the job of being chair.
-   There is a pool of site visitors, identified from previous symposium
    chairs or others who express interest. Any person chosen for the
    pool must be approved by the SIGCSE board before joining the pool.
-   The chair should identify one or two international SIGCSE members to
    serve in a consultation role. If there are no international members
    within the pool, which is most likely, the person in this role will
    be asked their opinion and insight about possible sites once the
    list has been narrowed down. The goal for this consultation is to
    provide any insight from an international perspective about proposed
    sites.

##### Process for bids from potential sites

1.  The Board and site visit chair propose a list of cities (5-8) and/or
    region to request bids from for a specified year.
2.  Site visit chair and junior chair (when appointed) request bids.
3.  Site visit chair and junior chair determine viable sites for
    visiting and a schedule.
4.  Site visit chair and junior chair schedule visits between them and
    for each visit find another person from the pool of site visitors
    (preferably one closest to the site). For each site visit:
    -   one chair must attend;
    -   a second person must attend; and,
    -   a third person may attend if both chairs are part of the site
        visit team.
5.  Visits occur and documentation spreadsheet (provided by the board)
    is completed with information returned to Board along with visit
    evaluation and recommendation. All material gathered during visit
    should be held and forwarded to the Board if a city is chosen (e.g.
    presentations given by the CVB, paper reports given the site visit
    team, proposal information).
6.  The Board evaluates information contained in spreadsheets, reports,
    and recommendations and votes.
7.  After the initial site visit recommendation is made and the Board
    approves the final site and contracts are signed, the site visit
    team should not sign any addendums or additional contracts without
    consulting with the Board first. At that time, it may be the case
    that the symposium chairs and/or meeting planners are consulted on
    the new contract (if those parties have already been appointed).

The suggested timeline is:

-   February/March Board meeting (at symposium) 20XX\
    20XX+3 Symposium Chairs approved

-   August (ideally) or October Board meeting 20XX (at latest)\
    20XX+3 Symposium site approved

##### Documentation of site visits
Each site visit team is requested to enter the site visit information in
a spreadsheet that will be used as a comparison mechanism for the Board.
The Board also encourages the team to supplement the spreadsheet with
textual/paragraphs of information in order to provide further
impressions of the site. Further, if feasible, a verbal report to the
Board/attendance at a Board meeting is desirable to facilitate further
exchange of information and communication about the sites.
