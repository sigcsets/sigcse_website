SIGCSE is one of the groups taking part in the Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL)project: Sustainability Improves Student Learning in STEM (SISL in STEM). Eleven disciplinary societies are working together to increase student learning in undergraduate STEM courses, and better prepare students for the real-world 21st century â€œBig Questions" that relate to real-world issues such as energy, air and water quality, and climate change.
