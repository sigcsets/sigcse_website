  - title: A Framework for Playing Network Games in CS1/CS2
    authors:
      - name: Richard E. Pattis
        email: pattis@acm.org
        affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University
    award: "$3,200"
    date: "May 2003"
    description: "I will develop a Java framework (and JavaDoc API) allowing CS1/CS2 students to write games played over a network. Games are hosted on one machine (storing shared state). Manual or automated players on other machines command/query it via strings. I'll write several assignments and sample games to distribute with this framework.

  - title: Student Program Documentation Analysis and Feedback
    authors:
      - name: Jesse M. Heines
        email: heines@cs.uml.edu
        affiliation: University of Massachusetts Lowell
    award: "$5,000"
    date: "May 2003"
    description: This project will produce a publicly available, Web-based application that analyzes program documentation and provides constructive feedback on how to improve that documentation. The final product will be similar in look and feel to the validators on the W3C Web site, but with added guidance on how to correct shortcomings. <a href="http://teaching.cs.uml.edu/~heines/projects/docvalidator">http://teaching.cs.uml.edu/~heines/projects/docvalidator</a>

  - title: Electronic Archiving of Workshop on Computer Architecture Education Proceedings
    authors:
      - name: Edward F. Gehringer
        email: efg@ncsu.edu
        affiliation: North Carolina State University
    award: "$1,600"
    date: "May 2003"
    description: "Since 1995, approximately ten Workshops in Computer Architecture Education have been held in conjunction with ACM/SIGArch conferences. The proposer has organized the last three workshops (2000, 2002, and 2003). The pre-2000 proceedings are not online or in any other archival form. The proposed activity is to pay a student to contact the authors, obtain the files, and put those proceedings on line with appropriate metadata.

  - title: Bioinformatics in the Computer Science Curriculum
    authors:
      - name: Matt DeJongh
        email: dejongh@hope.edu
      - name: Mark D. LeBlanc
        email: mleblanc@wheatoncollege.edu
        affiliation: Hope College; Wheaton College
    award: "$5,000"
    date: "July 2003"
    description: We propose to identify computationally rich examples from bioinformatics that map to core units in Computing Curricula 2001 and investigate ways of incorporating them into the computer science curriculum. We will develop sample course materials that will benefit members of SIGCSE who are interested in incorporating bioinformatics in their courses. <a href="http://www.cs.hope.edu/~dejongh/bioinformatics/sigcse/">http://www.cs.hope.edu/~dejongh/bioinformatics/sigcse/</a>

  - title: Task Force to Develop Java-Based Resources for Introductory CS
    authors:
      - name: Eric Roberts
        email: eroberts@cs.stanford.edu
        affiliation: Stanford University
    award: "$5,000"
    date: "October 2003"
    description: This project supports the work of a new ACM Education Board task force to develop a collection of Java-based resources to support the teaching of introductory computer science at both the secondary school and college level

  - title: Building Research in Australasian Computer Education (BRACE)
    authors:
      - name: Raymond Lister
        email: raymond@it.uts.edu.au
        affiliation: University of Technology, Sydney
    award: "$5,000"
    date: "October 2003"
    description: We propose to run a workshop on research into computer science education (4 days, up to 20 participants). The workshop leads onto a shared research project and publication(s). It will be set in Australasia, and modeled on two successful NSF-funded workshops previously held in America. <a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/brace">http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/brace</a>
