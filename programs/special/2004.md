  - title: Creating Computer Exercises Involving Computer Security
    authors:
      - name: Charles Ashbacher
        affiliation: Mount Mercy College
    award: "$1,000"
    date: "February 2004"
    description: "This project will develop software to demonstrate particular concepts in computer security: code obfuscation and steganography (in this case, the hiding of messages in image files). The final source code and documentation will be released as open source and posted on the SIGCSE web site."

  - title: A Remote Program Viewer
    authors:
      - name: Charles Dierbach
        email: cdierbach@towson.edu
        affiliation: Towson University
    award: "$2,768"
    date: "May 2004"
    description: "This project involves the development of a remote program viewer allowing two users anywhere across the Internet to view a common set of program files and interactively discuss. Such a tool would be useful for both student-instructor interaction, and collaborative learning by students. <a href=\"http://triton.towson.edu/~dierbach/RemoteViewer/Main.htm\">http://triton.towson.edu/~dierbach/RemoteViewer/Main.htm</a>"

  - title: Projects in Wireless and Ad-Hoc Network Simulation
    authors:
      - name: Chris McDonald
        affiliation: University of Western Australia
    award: "$2,700"
    date: "May 2004"
    description: This project will extend the existing cnet networking simulator to support the exciting new areas of mobile and ad-hoc networks through the addition of wireless Ethernet and Bluetooth communication links. New laboratory and project exercises, examining table-driven and on-demand protocols, will also be developed.

  - title: "Towards the development of \"best practices\" for teaching information assurance courses"
    authors:
      - name: Rose Shumba
        email: shumba@iup.edu
        affiliation: Indiana University of Pennsylvania
    award: "$2,853"
    date: "July 2004"
    description: "The aim of this project is to provide some groundwork towards the development of \"best practices\" for the teaching of information assurance courses. This will be achieved by the evaluation of the effectiveness of available CERT recommended security tools, developing hands-on laboratory exercises for the tools and then integrating the developed hands- on lab exercises and the theories and principles of information assurance courses. A student will be hired to assist with the project."

  - title: "A visualization system to support software development comprehension: evaluation"
    authors:
      - name: Charles Boisvert
        email: cboisver@ccn.ac.uk
        affiliation: City College Norwich, UK
    award: "$4896"
    date: "August 2004"
    description: eL-CID supports students' understanding of program development by visualising development history. This project aims to evaluate eL-CID with introductory programming students in a classroom setting. I will build a set of teaching examples and carry out a questionnaire evaluation, analyze forum transcripts and if conditions allow run a crossover study.

  - title: Designing and Evaluating Programs in Computer Science Education
    authors:
      - name: Justus Randolph

    award: "$4,750"
    date: "August 2004"
    description: A research project to develop best practices in designing and evaluating programs in CS education is proposed. Research activities will include a systematic review of CSE programs and confirm tory case studies of the design and evaluation process of three CSE programs
 
  - title: A Course on Ethical Issues in Computing Linking Students at Villanova University and Universidade Nova de Lisboa
    authors:
      - name: William Fleischman
        email: william.fleischman@villanova.edu
        affiliation: Villanova University and Universidade Nova de Lisboa
    award: "$3,400"
    date: "December 2004"
    description: This project will support development of course materials and implementation of interactive videoconference sessions linking undergraduate students at Villanova University and Universidade Nova de Lisboa in discussions of ethical issues in computing. The project is seen as a means of broadening the perspectives of students at both institutions
