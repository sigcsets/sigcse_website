special-awards:
  - title: "Programming External RAM via a PC Parallel Port"
    authors:
      - name: David Heise
        email: dheise@ccis.edu
        affiliation: Columbia College
    award: "$2,000"
    date: "March 2005"
    description: "This project will create the hardware and software tools for Computer Architecture students to load programs onto the processor they construct for the course from a PC parallel port, obviating the tedious process of programming machine code using switches."

  - title: "Software Architecture Improvement through Test-driven Development: An Empirical Study"
    authors:
      - name: David Janzen
        email: DJANZEN@bethelks.edu
        affiliation: Bethel College
    award: "$4,635"
    date: "May 2005"
    description: "Test-driven development promises to improves software through both design and testing. This project will perform a series of empirical studies that will examine the efficacy of test-driven development, explore its place in the undergraduate curriculum, and evaluate an educational approach called test-driven learning."

  - title: "Training to Persist in Computing Careers"
    authors:
      - name: Kristi Honaker
        email: pace_nsf@vt.edu
        affiliation: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
    award: "$4,900"
    date: "July 2005"
    description: "We will develop a Career Resilience toolkit and training module designed to help students cope with computing career stressors. The project's ultimate goal is to retain minority computing students by encouraging the development of soft skills and coping strategies. The toolkit will include step-by-step modules SIGCSE members can facilitate."
