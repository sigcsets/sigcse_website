      - name: William Byrd
        email: webyrd@gmail.com
    award: "$2700"
    date: "December 2014"
    description: "The CS Education Zoo is an ongoing series of hour-long video blogs led by Will Byrd and Steven Wolfman in which the hosts discuss CS Education with guests from various positions and backgrounds. Guests include university CS educators in various positions, Computer Scientists in industry positions with particular insight on CS education, CS education researchers, and non-traditional CS educators. The show's goals include spreading best CS education practices, inspiring educators to try innovative practices, sharing viewpoints with educators that they would rarely receive, and exposing the often private practice of teaching. The project will yield an improved, sustainable web and social media presence; sixteen polished episodes that are easy to view, search, and share; and an ongoing positive impact on dissemination of ideas in CS education."

    award: "$3650"
    date: "December 2014"
    description: "Based on the premise that people live surrounded by information, resources, experiences, and knowledge shared through the Internet, this research project explores how the reality of person-plus-crowd is reflected in the practices, values, and capabilities of professional programmers, students, and teachers.  The results of this project will be used to address the important pedagogical questions of how CS education should change given this reality, as well as what and how students should be taught to better prepare them for this aspect of their professional lives outside school."

  - title: "Assessing the Potential of Evolved Parsons Puzzles as Compared to Their Instructor-designed Counterparts"
    files:
      - file: SP-report-2014-gaspar.pdf
        label: Final project report
    authors:

      - name: Amruth Kumar
        email: amruth@ramapo.edu
    award: "$3650"
    date: "December 2014"
    description: "This project extends the Problets programming tutor to handle both instructor-designed and autonomously evolved Parsons Puzzles. Parsons Puzzles present students with shuffled fragments of a valid program’s source, its requirements, and bugged fragments – “distractors”.  They require students to select appropriate fragments to reconstitute the original program.  The extended Problets programming tutor will be used to conduct a comparative study of both instructor-designed problems and automatically generated problems."

  - title: "Creating Successful Computing Clubs in NJ Middle and Elementary Schools"
    files:
      - file: SP-report-2014-trees.pdf
        label: Final project report
    authors:
      - name: Frances P. Trees
        email: fran.trees@cs.rutgers.edu
    award: "$4,300"
    date: "May 2014"
    description: "This project will provide professional development to 20 middle school and elementary school teachers in the area of computing concepts with the goals of having these teachers initiate a computer club or integrate computing concepts in their current curriculum. Professional development and ongoing support and mentoring will be provided. The ultimate goal is to involve these teachers in the creation a Computer Club Guidebook to present to NJ State Department of Education for implementation in other schools statewide.  The Computer Club Guidebook will be available to others seeking to establish similar clubs."

  - title: "Evolving the Introductory Computing Sequence to be CSG-Ed Focused"
    authors:
      - name: Michael Goldweber
        email: mikeyg@cs.xu.edu
    award: "$5,000"
    date: "May 2014"
    description: "Computing curricula, particularly the introductory sequence, often reinforce student misconceptions regarding the discipline. Computer Science educational activities for the social good (CSG-Ed), is a term meant to incorporate any educational activity that endeavors to convey and reinforce computing's social relevance and potential for positive societal impact. This project will evolve the computing curricula at five of New Zealand's leading institutions to be significantly more CSG-Ed infused, particularly at the introductory level."
