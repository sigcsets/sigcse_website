  - title: "Making Block Languages Accessible"

      - file: SP-report-2016-ladner.pdf
        label: Final Report
    authors:
      - name: "Richard E. Ladner"
        affiliation: University of Washington
        email: ladner@cs.washington.edu
    award: "$4,064"
    date: "May 2016"
    description: "Block languages such as Scratch, Snap!, Alice, Blockly, App Inventor, ScratchJr, and others, have opened up programming and problem solving to millions of children worldwide.  This project will make block languages accessible to blind children so they can have the same opportunities as their sighted peers. Most blind children in the US are already familiar with smartphones and tablets including the gestures used to navigate and spatially understand what is on a touchscreen. This project will extend the open source Blockly language by building on touchscreen phone applications."

    authors:
      - name: Mark M. Meysenburg
        affiliation: Doane University
        email: mark.meysenburg@doane.edu
    award: "$3,000"
    date: "May 2016"
    description: "Dr. Meysenburg will create a Reacting to the Past role-playing game, \"The Dawn of Computing: Charles Babbage and the Difference Engine,\" regarding British polymath Charles Babbage and his quest to build his difference engine. The game can be used in general-audience first-year seminar courses, to encourage students to study computing.  Reacting to the Past games revolve around debate, with groups of students divided into factions aligned to different sides of the issue at hand.  The central issue at stake in “The Dawn of Computing: Charles Babbage and the Difference Engine” will be whether or not Babbage should be awarded funds from the British government for the development of the difference engine, first in 1823 and then in an ongoing manner. The outcome will be in the hands of the students."

  - title: "A Tutoring System for Red Black Trees"

      - file: SP-report-2018-liew.pdf
        label: Final project report
    authors:
      - name: Chun Wai Liew

        email: liewc@lafayette.edu
    award: "$4,387"
    date: "May 2016"
    description: A web based tutoring system will be developed to help students learn top-down insertion and deletion algorithms in balanced trees, specifically in red-black trees.  The tutoring system will help students recognize the preconditions for single and double rotation transformations.  The system will allow instructors to provide problems and will automatically generate solution paths.

  - title: "Inclusive Apps: Supporting Mobile Accessibility Standards through Educational Exercises"
    files: 
      - file: SP-report-2017-elglaly.pdf
        label: Final project report
    authors:
      - name: Yasmine N. El-Glaly
        email: ynevse@rit.edu
        affiliation: Rochester Institute of Technology
      - name: Daniel E. Krutz
        email: dxkvse@rit.edu
        affiliation: Rochester Institute of Technology
    award: "$3,800"
    date: "December 2016"
    description: Drs. El-Glaly and Krutz will create a publicly accessible oracle of mobile applications which will define problems relating to the accessibility of mobile applications for individuals with disabilities. The oracle will contain a library of well-defined accessibility problems, provide details about the accessibility issues, and demonstrate the difficulties experienced by users with different needs or who are differently abled. The oracle will outline steps to modify each application to make it accessible to users affected by the accessibility issue. The oracle will be available for use at other educational institutions to support software development and accessibility related courses.

  - title: "What Exactly Are We Expecting Our Novice Programming Students to Achieve?"
    files:
      - file: SP-report-2016-becker.pdf
        label: Final project report
    authors:
      - name: Brett A. Becker
        affiliation: University College Dublin
        email: brett.becker@ucd.ie
    award: "$4,700"
    date: "December 2016"
    description: "Dr. Brett Becker will collect, categorize and analyze the learning outcome statements of CS1 courses across a large, diverse set of institutions, providing an answer to the question: What exactly are we expecting our novice programming students to achieve? This will allow the CS education community to decide if, as recent evidence has suggested, we have unrealistic expectations of our CS1 students. The outputs of this research will provide a starting point for the CS education community to adjust its expectations of novice programmers, resulting in improvements in failure rates, retention, diversity and equity in CS education.  Upon completion of the project an online repository of CS1 learning outcomes will be available to, and updatable by, the CS education community."
