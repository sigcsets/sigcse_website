    award: $5,000
    date: November 2019
    description: "We want to plant the seeds for a community of practice on Mastery Learning for Programming Courses, by making our lessons learned and resources available in an easily adoptable way."

  - title: "An Online Tool for Easy-to-set-up and Auto-gradable Full Tracing Exercises"
    authors:
      - name: Wei Jin
        affiliation: "Georgia Gwinnett College, Lawrenceville, Georgia, USA"
    award: $5,000
    date: November 2019
    description: "We propose a web-based system that allows instructors to set up auto-gradable full tracing exercises easily. We will utilize pythontutor.com, a popular open-source code visualization tool, as the underlying system. The augmented system will help engage students in the learning process by require students to determine which line is executed next and what happens in memory/output before the system demonstrates the step."

  - title: "The Crossroads of Computer Science: Stories of ‘Sideways’ and ‘Hidden’ Computer Scientists"
    authors:
      - name: Brett Becker
        affiliation: "University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland"
    award: $4,785
    date: November 2019

  - title: "Developing Coding Instruction Videos for K12 Hearing Impaired Students Using American Sign Language"
    authors:
      - name: Daniela Marghitu
        affiliation: "Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, USA"
    award: $3,500
    date: November 2019
    description: "A number of ambitious projects such as ASLCORE 6 and ASLClear 7 are working on creating American Sign Language (ASL) signs for STEM disciplines. For example, in the computer science domain, ASLCORE has produced signs for concepts such as “Recursion”, “Debugger”, “Linked List” and “Variable”. In this way, computer science jargon is being made accessible to students who are hearing impaired. Drag and Drop coding applications such as MIT’s Scratch 8 are popularly used to teach K-12 students to code. Our project aims to make computer science concepts, using Block-based coding, a more inclusive experience for hearing impaired students."
