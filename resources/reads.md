SIGCSE Reads is a community-led project that allows a growing community of SIGCSE members connect to each other through science fiction. Becky Bates, Judy Goldsmith, Valerie Summet, and Nanette Veilleux organize a get together to discuss that year's reading selections. The group often meets at a Birds of a Feather session at the Technical Symposium. The stories are selected via popular vote and email discussions in the SIGCSE listerv.

### 2024

By popular vote, the novella _The Lifecycle of Software Objects_ by Ted Chiang.

For our non-fiction option, a dive into what we can do individually to make our community more inclusive _Sister Resisters: Mentoring Black Women on Campus_ by Janie Ward and Tracy Robinson-Wood <https://www.hepg.org/hep-home/books/sister-resisters>.

And for a quicker read, the short story _Dolly_ by Elizabeth Bear (available online <https://apex-magazine.com/short-fiction/dolly/>).
